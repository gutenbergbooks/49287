  <h2 id='ch01' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'>THE GRAND CAÑON OF ARIZONA</span><br /> <br />BY WILLIAM HASKELL SIMPSON</h2>


<p class='c010' >Many of those who seek and love earth's
greatest scenery have declared that they
found it at the Grand Cañon of Arizona.
Travelers flock to it from the ends of the earth,
though the majority of the visitors, numbering
every year about a hundred thousand, are Americans.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Grand Cañon of the Colorado River, in
northern Arizona, is indeed a world wonder, and
there is no other chasm in the world worthy to be
compared with it. It is more than two hundred
miles long, including Marble Cañon, is from ten
to thirteen miles wide in the granite gorge section,
and is more than a mile deep. It was created
ages and ages ago by the erosive action of water,
wind, and frost, and it is still being deepened and
widened imperceptibly year by year.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Colorado River, which drains a region of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
three hundred thousand square miles and is two
thousand miles long from the rise of its principal
source, is formed in southern Utah by the
junction of the Grand and the Green Rivers, and,
flowing through Utah and Arizona to tide-water
at the Gulf of California, it dashes in headlong
torrent through this titanic gorge&mdash;this dream of
color, tinted like a rainbow or a sunset.</p>

<p class='c011' >The cañon is reached by a railroad running to
the rim, and may be visited any day in the year.
It is unlike most other scenery, because when
standing on its rim you look down instead of up.
Imagine a gigantic trough, filled with bare
mountains on each side and sloping to a narrow
channel, which in turn is carved deeply and
steeply out of solid granite. You come upon it
unawares from the level, timbered, plateau
country. The experience is an absolutely unique
one. Only when you go down one of the trails
to the bottom and look up is the view more nearly
like other grand mountain vistas. The first
glimpse always is from the upper edge, and, having
no previous standard of measurement, you
find it difficult to adjust yourself to this strange
condition. The distant rim swims in a bluish
haze. The nearer red rocks forming the inner
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
cañon buttes&mdash;crowned with massive table-lands
that look like temples, minarets, and battlements&mdash;reflect
the sunlight in myriad hues. It seems
a vast illusion rather than reality. No wonder
that the first look often awes the spectator into
silence and tears!</p>

<p class='c011' >But, before you have been here long, you will
wish to know how it all happened. You will ask
how the cañon was made.</p>

<p class='c011' >That question was asked by a little girl of Captain
John Hance, one of the pioneer guides.
Hance contests with a few other early comers the
distinction of being the biggest "romancer" in
Arizona. He told her that he dug it all himself.</p>

<p class='c011' >"Why, Captain Hance!" she said, in astonishment,
"what did you do with all the dirt?"</p>

<p class='c011' >He quickly replied, "I built the San Francisco
Peaks off there with it!"</p>

<p class='c011' >Just between ourselves, no one absolutely can
tell just how the miracle occurred, for no human
being was there at the time. But the geologist
has put together, bit by bit, thousands of facts,
dug from the rocks which here lie exposed like a
mammoth layer-cake and his explanation is so
convincing that it must stand as at least the probable
truth.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
Here may be seen rocks of the four geological
periods which are among the very oldest of our
earth. The rocks of later periods were here
once, too, making a layer more than two miles
high resting on what is to-day the top, but in some
remote age they were shaved off by some great
natural force, perhaps a glacier.</p>

<p class='c011' >The eating away of the rocks which formed the
cañon itself is modern. Scientists say it was
done, as it were, last Monday or Tuesday, for it
was when the top two thirds had been "shaved
off," as we have said, that the Colorado River began
to cut the Grand Cañon through the rocks
that formed the lower third.</p>

<p class='c011' >While the cracking of the crust, caused by internal
fires, may have helped the process of cañon-making,
the result of erosion is seen everywhere.
Every passing shower, every desert wind, every
snowfall, changes the contour of the region imperceptibly
but surely. The cañon is Nature's
open book in which we may read how the earth
was built.</p>

<p class='c011' >With the coming of the railroad, when this
century was yet a baby, tourists began to flock
in, hotels were built, highways constructed, trails
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
bettered, and other improvements made. To-day
the traveler finds here every comfort.</p>

<p class='c011' >Although first glimpsed by white men in 1540,
when the Spanish conquistadors appeared,&mdash;one
expedition journeying from the Hopi pueblos in
Tusayan across the Painted Desert,&mdash;the big
cañon remained unvisited, except for Indians and
trappers, until 1858, when Lieutenant Ives, of the
army engineer corps, made a brief exploration
of the lower reaches of the Colorado, coming out
at Cataract Creek. It was not thoroughly explored
until the year 1869, when Major John W.
Powell made his memorable voyage from the entrance
to the mouth of the great gorge, passing
down the Green and Colorado Rivers. Though
he lost two boats and four men, he pushed on to
the end. It is fitting that the United States
Government has erected to his memory a massive
monument of native rock with bronze tablets on
one of the points near El Tovar Hotel.</p>

<p class='c011' >Powell's outfit consisted of nine men and four
rowboats. The distance traveled exceeded one
thousand miles, from what is now Greenriver,
Utah, through the series of cañons to the mouth
of the Rio Virgin. In the spring of 1871 he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
again started with three boats and descended the
river to the Crossing of the Fathers. The following
summer Lee's Ferry was his point of departure
and he went as far as the mouth of Kanab
Wash.</p>

<p class='c011' >Beginning with the Russell and Monett party,
in 1907, several others have essayed to duplicate
Powell's achievement, and successfully, too,
though without adding to our scientific knowledge
of the cañon. The trips are exceedingly dangerous,
for the rapids conceal rocks that would
wreck any boat, and the currents are treacherous.
It is safer, by far, to sit at home and read
Powell's story.</p>

<p class='c011' >The average traveler spends too short a time
at the cañon. He arrives in the morning and
leaves in the evening. Those wise ones, who go
about things in more leisurely fashion, stay from
three days to a week.</p>

<p class='c011' >There are certain things that everybody does.
Simply by looking through the big telescope at
the "lookout," an intimate view may be had of the
far-off north rim and of the river gorge five miles
below in an air line. It is easier than actually
going to those places, though both are accessible.
The north rim, or Kaibab Plateau, is about a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
quarter of a mile higher than the south rim,
where you are standing, and is thickly forested
with giant pines. Clear streams are found here,
and wild game in abundance. Mountain-lions
hide in the rocks, and bobcats haunt the trees. It
is the home of the bear, too; you may see two
"sassy" young sample specimens outside the
house where the Indians stay, opposite El Tovar
Hotel. The way across the cañon to the north
side is not an easy one, as the Colorado must be
crossed in a steel cage suspended from a cable,
which stretches dizzily from bank to bank. Then
follows the stiff climb up Bright Angel Creek,
along a trail seldom used.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Hopi House, where the Indians give their
dances every evening for free entertainment of
guests, is another attraction. It is occupied by
representatives of the Snake Dance Hopis, whose
home is many miles northeast across the Painted
Desert. You won't see the Snake Dance, of
course, but you will witness ceremonies just as
interesting, participated in by men, women and
children of the Hopi and Navajo tribes. The
little tots, especially, are very "cute." They execute
difficult steps in perfect time and with the
utmost solemnity, while the drummer beats the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
tom-tom, and the singer chants his weird songs.</p>

<p class='c011' >Here you may see Navajo silversmiths at work,
fashioning curious ornaments from Mexican
coins and turquoise, also deft weavers of blankets
and baskets.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Havasupai Reservation, in Cataract
Cañon, is about sixty miles away, and Indians
from that hidden place of the blue waterfalls are
frequent visitors around the railway station.</p>

<p class='c011' >All of these Indians understand the language
of Uncle Sam. Many of them are Carlisle or
Riverside graduates, and one young Hopi is writing
a history of his tribe in university English.</p>

<p class='c011' >Have you ever ridden a mule? If not, you will
learn how at the cañon, for only on muleback can
travelers easily make the trip down and up the
trail. Walking is all right going down, but the
climb coming back will tire out the strongest
hiker: hence the mule, or burro, long as to ears,
long as to memory, and "sad as to his songs."</p>

<p class='c011' >Of the visitors, fat and lean, tall and short, old
and young, to each is assigned a mule of the right
size and disposition, together with a khaki riding-suit,
which fits more or less, all surmounted by
hats that are useful rather than ornamental. It
is a motley crowd that starts off in the morning,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
in charge of careful guides, from the roof of the
world&mdash;a motley crowd, but gay and suspiciously
cheerful. It is likewise a motley crowd that
slowly climbs up out of the earth toward evening&mdash;but
subdued and inclined still to cling to the
patient mule.</p>

<p class='c011' >"What did you see?" asked curious friends.</p>

<p class='c011' >Quite likely they saw more mule than cañon,
being concerned with the immediate views along
the trail rather than the thrilling vistas unfolding
at each turn. Nine out of ten of them could
tell you their mule's name, yet would hesitate to
say much about Zoroaster or Angel's Gate.
They could identify the steep descent of the
Devil's Corkscrew, for they were a part of it; the
mystery of the deep gulf, stretching overhead and
all around, probably did not reach them. That
is the penalty one pays for being too much occupied
with things close at hand.</p>

<p class='c011' >Yet only by crawling down into the awe-full
depths can the cañon be fully comprehended afterward
from the upper rim.</p>

<p class='c011' >All trail parties take lunch on the river's bank.
The Colorado is about two hundred feet wide
here, and lashed into foam by the rapids. Its
roar is like that of a thousand express-trains.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
The place seems uncanny. At night, under the
stars, you appear to be in another world.</p>

<p class='c011' >No water is to be found on the south rim for
one hundred miles east and west of El Tovar,
except what falls in the passing summer showers,
and that is quickly soaked up by the dry soil.
All the water used for the small army of horses
and mules maintained by the transportation department,
likewise for the big hotel and annex
and other facilities, is hauled by rail in tank-cars
from a point one hundred and twenty-five miles
distant. The vast volume of water in the Colorado
River, only seven miles away, is not available.
No way has yet been found to pump
economically the precious fluid from a river that
to-day is thirty feet deep, and to-morrow is
seventy feet deep, flowing below you at the depth
of over a mile.</p>

<p class='c011' >Another curious fact is this: the drainage on the
south side is away from the cañon, not into it.
The ground at the edge of the abyss is higher
than it is a few miles back.</p>

<p class='c011' >During the winter of 1917 there was an unusual
fall of snow, which covered the sides and
bottom of the cañon down to the river. Nothing
like it had been seen for a quarter of a century.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
Generally, what little snow falls is confined to the
rim and the upper slopes. At times the immense
gulf was completely filled with clouds, and then
the cañon looked like an inland lake. As a rule,
this part of Arizona is a land of sunshine; the
high altitude means cool summers; the southerly
latitude means pleasant winters.</p>

<p class='c011' >Naturally, a place like the Grand Cañon has attracted
many great artists and other distinguished
visitors. Moving-picture companies
have staged thrilling photo-plays in these picturesque
surroundings. Photographers by the
score have trained their finest batteries of lenses
on rim, trail, and river, some of them getting
remarkable results in natural colors.</p>

<p class='c011' >Unmoved by this galaxy of talent, however, the
Grand Cañon refuses wholly to give up its secrets.
Always there will be something new for the
seeker and interpreter of to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Grand Cañon is a forest reserve and a national
monument. A bill has been introduced
in Congress to make it a national park. Meanwhile,
the United States Forest Service and the
railway company are doing all they can to increase
the facilities for visitors. A forest ranger
is located near by. His force looks out for fires,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
and polices the Tusayan Forest district. Covering
such a large area with only a few men, a
system has been worked out for locating fires
quickly. Fifteen minutes saved, often means
victory snatched from defeat. Water is not
available, for this is a waterless region except
during the short rainy season, so recourse must
be had to other devices, such as back-firing and
smothering with dirt.</p>

<p class='c011' >Official government names for prominent objects
in the region have been substituted for most
of the old-time local names. For example, your
attention is invited to Yavapai Point, so called
after a tribe of Indians, instead of O'Neill's
Point. These American Indian words are
musical and belong to the country, and the names
of Spanish explorers and Aztec rulers also seem
suited to the place. Thus the great cañon has
been saved the fate of bearing the hackneyed or
prosaic names that have been given to many
places of wonderful natural beauty throughout
our country. Think of a "Lover's Leap" down
an abyss of several thousand feet! That
atrocity, happily, has been spared us in this
favored region.</p>

<p class='c011' >This great furrow on the brow of Arizona
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
never can be made common by the hand of man.
It is too big for ordinary desecration. Always
it will be the ideal Place of Silence. Let us continue
to hope that the incline railway will not be
established here, suitable though it may be elsewhere,
nor the merry-go-round. The useful
automobile is barred on the highway along the
edge of the chasm, though it is permitted in other
sections.</p>

<p class='c011' >It has been my good fortune to meet at the
cañon many noted artists, writers, lecturers,
"movie" celebrities, singers, and preachers. The
impression made upon each one of them by this
titanic chasm is almost always the same. At
first, outward indifference&mdash;on guard not to be
overwhelmed, for they have seen much, the wide
world over. Then a restrained enthusiasm, but
with emotions well in check. After longer acquaintance,
more enthusiasm and less restraint.
At the end, full surrender to the magic spell.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>IN RAINBOW-LAND</span><br /> <br />BY AMY SUTHERLAND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Until only a few years ago, the Greatest
Wonder of the World lay hidden away in
one of the most savage parts of Africa. The
natives of that region, terrified by its mysterious
columns of vapor and its subterranean thunder,
did not venture within many miles of it. The
white men who had looked upon it could be
counted on the fingers of one hand.</p>

<p class='c011' >And yet, more than fifty years have passed
since the explorer Livingstone, journeying eastward
along the Zambesi, first beheld that rainbow
mist rise above the forest. Of its cause he
could learn nothing from the savages; and so,
except for his own conjectures, he came quite unprepared
upon his splendid discovery. He approached
it by the river, which above the Falls is
a mile wide, and below them runs for fifty miles
at the bottom of a gorge between four and five
hundred feet deep, whose twin walls of black, precipitous
rock show for all that distance scarcely
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
a ledge or slope where the smallest plant may
cling. So, after a peep downward at the Falls,
from the island on their brink which now bears
his name, he left his new-found marvel less than
half seen, and departed whence he came.</p>

<p class='c011' >And the loneliness of those vast solitudes
brooded once more over forest and river, to be
broken only at rare intervals by some wandering
hunter, or perhaps by a party of men adventuring
through endless toil and danger to behold a
wonder whose fame, even then, spread as far as
that tiny portion of South Africa where white
men dwelt and civilization held sway. So things
remained until the day of Cecil Rhodes, under
whose auspices went forth the <i>voortrekkers</i>, or
pioneers, to colonize the vast land now called
Rhodesia, in the heart of which the Victoria Falls
lie. Many of these voortrekkers, and their wives
and children, died at the hands of the savage
Amatabele tribe of natives; but the survivors in
the end were victorious, and the country became
their own.</p>

<p class='c011' >Cecil Rhodes died, and was laid in his lonely
grave among the Matopo Hills, on a rocky summit
which looks far out over the land he loved.
But his wishes were remembered, the greatest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
and the least of them; and still, year by year, the
Central African Railway grows, every year a
little, northward through the forests. And now
it has reached the Zambesi, and over that hitherto
unconquerable gorge has been thrown one of the
most wonderful railway bridges ever built; and
close by has sprung up a great hotel, so that the
Victoria Falls and their surroundings are attainable
at last by all the world.</p>

<p class='c011' >For many days the approaching traveler has
been flying through a mighty tropical forest, in
which a path has been cut for the railway line, but
which is otherwise so undisturbed, so vast and
silent and lonely, that it is hard to believe white
men can ever make a home in it. Here the lion
prowls at his own sweet will, and legions of antelopes,
great and small, graze on the sweet veldt.
And here elephants wander in troops of fifty or
more, and in the swamps the hippopotamus plows
his way through the papyrus reed and the ten-foot
Rhodesian grass. The little iron shanties
of the railway men are the only signs of civilized
life. The natives of the country are few and far
between; their kraals, with the conical huts peculiar
to this race of Africans, look down from the
rare, slight eminences.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
There is no change in the scenery, little to give
warning of the wonder that one approaches.
Only, above the noise of the train, a far-off murmur
of sound grows upon the ear; and a little
while later, floating upward from out the forest,
there comes in sight a long line of snowy vapor,
which, as the low sun touches it, glows with soft,
many-colored lights. This mist-cloud is caused
by the sudden narrowing of the great Zambesi
River in the Chasm, not two hundred yards wide,
which receives the Falls at the end of their leap.
The cloud rises at times as much as five hundred
feet into the air, and there condenses into rain,
which falls in eternal showers glorious in this
thirsty land, and makes in the country close about
the Falls one perpetual spring.</p>

<p class='c011' >This tract of land is known as the Rain Forest,
and in its tropical magnificence, its soft and delicate
beauty, can surely be surpassed by nothing
on earth. All about the path laboriously cut
through its jungles, rise the trunks of splendid
trees, which seem to tower into the very sky;
their stems, and the earth about them, are hidden
in masses of giant ferns, whose long sprays sway
and quiver continually under the weight of the
falling drops. Strange plants of many kinds
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
grow here; orchids droop from the trees, and
palms raise their graceful heads from out the
tangle. Through it all drift the rainbow vapors,
and from between the trees the sun strikes in
long, slanting rays, and lights up the wet vegetation,
the rising mist, the falling raindrops, with
an effect so tenderly and unutterably lovely that
it often brings tears to the eyes.</p>

<p class='c011' >In places the forest is more open, and here the
giant Rhodesian grass grows, twelve feet high,
its flower-heads heavy with wet; and palms, free
from the jungle and able to grow as they will, rise
thirty feet into the air, their every fringed leaf
hung with gems.</p>

<p class='c011' >At any time a few steps will take the traveler
from out this Forest of Rainbows, to where he
may stand on the very verge of the terrific Chasm.
Here he is directly opposite the Falls, which come
rushing over the further tip in a mass of foam as
white as snow, to fall with a roar more than four
hundred feet into the dreadful abyss. By leaning
over, it is possible at times to see the river at
the bottom, a boiling, turbulent torrent racing
furiously to the right along its rock-bound bed;
but more often all is hidden in the mist, which is
hurled upward so densely that in places the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
Chasm seems choked with it, and it rushes past
the observer with an audible sound and a suggestion
of irresistible force, awe-inspiring to a degree.
Opposite the Main Falls, a spot known to
the natives as Shongwe, the Caldron, it is so
heavy as to blot out sky, forest, and even the Falls
themselves, and we are in a strange twilight, half
smothered in vapors and wholly deafened with
the thunderous roar of the Falls so close at
hand.</p>

<p class='c011' >Everywhere are double rainbows of surpassing
brightness, sometimes arches, sometimes complete,
glowing circles. They are so close, one
may watch their melting colors as in a soapbubble;
and they move and change continually with
the sun or the movements of the spectator. They
gleam softly in the cloud, brilliantly against the
stern black cliffs; and tiny rainbows by hundreds
dance in the falling sheets of water and among
the palms and ferns of the forest.</p>

<p class='c011' >A strange circumstance cannot fail to strike
the observer, and awe him, as perhaps nothing
else could, with a sense of the vast depth of the
fissure into which he fearfully gazes. The spray
and rain bring into being hundreds of streams,
which flash over the edge of the cliff opposite the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
Falls in an eternal effort to rejoin their parent
river. But they never reach the bottom. Long
before they are half-way down, they vanish, dissipated
once more into spray, and borne upward
in the form of lighted mist.</p>

<p class='c011' >Of the radiant beauty of the whole scene, one
writer, a traveler of renown, says:</p>

<p class='c011' >"I believe that on that day I was gazing at the
most perfectly beautiful spectacle of all this beautiful
world.</p>

<p class='c011' >"As the sun's rays fell on that kaleidoscopic,
ever-moving, changing scene, made up of rock,
water, mist, and shivering foliage, the coloring
of it all was gorgeous, yet of sweetly tender tints
under that luminous, pearly atmosphere formed
by the spray-mist. Below, where one caught
glimpses of the rushing water, it was turned
brown and golden, blue and rich dark green.
The cliff, sparkling with dripping water, was of
shining black and glowing bronze. The foliage
of the Rain Forest was of the green of an eternal
spring, and a myriad jewels of twinkling light
were made by the water-drops on the trembling
leaves. A glorious rainbow spanned the Chasm,
and other rainbows flitted in the haze. As for
the tender, pale beauty of the Cataract and of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
luminous, pearly mist, no words could convey it
to the imagination."</p>

<p class='c011' >Another writer says: "The beauty of the
pearl-tinted atmosphere, and the glory of the
dazzling rainbows, are the first and the last impressions
that the Victoria Falls give to the
mind."</p>

<p class='c011' >The eastern extremity of the cliff opposite the
Falls is known as Danger Point; and here the
Chasm turns abruptly at right angles, and becomes
the famous Gorge which for fifty miles
zigzags across country, with the Zambesi like a
silver cord at the bottom of it. Just at the turning-point,
a mass of rock has fallen from the cliff
and lies below in the river&mdash;a mass which, it is
interesting to note, Livingstone describes as just
<i>ready to fall</i>, and which in his drawing of the
scene is represented as almost parted from the
rest. Along the Gorge a strong, cold wind blows
always, and bears the mist as far as the railway
bridge and the exquisite palm groves near it.</p>

<p class='c011' >Above the Falls, the scene is scarcely less fair.
Here lies the broad Zambesi, placid and calm
under its sunny skies, with its fifty islands, palm-crowned,
wonderful, kept ever green and spring-like
by the soft spray-showers. On the banks
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
grows the burly baobab, whose trunk is as large
as a house; lovely forest fringes either shore,
and gay-plumaged birds flit among the flowering
trees and feast on the plentiful wild fruits.
From here the mists of Victoria take the form
of five towering pillars, bending with the wind,
white below, but dark farther up, where they condense
into rain. Livingstone says of the river at
this point: "No one can imagine the beauty of
the view from anything witnessed elsewhere. It
had never been seen before by European eyes;
but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon
by angels in their flight."</p>

<p class='c011' >The monstrous footprints of the hippopotami
are thick along the banks, and crocodiles lie sunning
themselves in the open spaces. Tiny gray
monkeys, with wise black faces, swing from the
miles of creeper which festoon the trees. Green
parrots shriek, and strange great reptiles crash a
path through the tangle. The savage natives
punt or paddle their dugouts on the placid bosom
of the river. So recent is the white man's advent
that the whole is scarcely changed from the day
when David Livingstone first looked upon it and
realized, with beating heart, the Wonder he had
found.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>TRAVELING IN INDIA</span><br /> <br />BY MABEL ALBERTA SPICER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Here in the Western world, where everything
is hustle and bustle, where express-trains,
automobiles, telephones, telegraphs, pneumatic
tubes, and, most recently, aëroplanes save
us hours of time, it is difficult to realize that on
the other side of the world things are moving
along at the same slow pace at which they did
centuries ago. Also, here in America, where
everybody is saying, "I have no time, I have no
time, I have no time!" it seems strange to think
that there are countries where time has no value
whatsoever, where people believe they have to
live thousands and thousands of lives before they
reach their heaven, and, consequently, have no
regard for time.</p>

<p class='c011' >Imagine spending the whole night in the train
to go one or two hundred miles! Imagine, also,
everybody's surprise if some traveler should attempt
to take with him into an American sleeping-car
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
a roll of bedding, a box of ice, sawdust,
and bottles of soda-water, a huge lunch-basket,
spirit-lamps, umbrella-cases, hat-boxes, suitcases
and bags without number, a talkative parrot, and
a folding chair or two! He would be thought
quite mad, of course, and would not be allowed
to enter the car. Yet this is how people travel in
the trains of India. Sometimes, to be sure, the
chairs and noisy parrot are left at home, but quite
as often golf-sticks and a folding cot are substituted.
Native travelers often carry their cooking-utensils
and stoves with them. No one is in
a hurry, and the train often waits quite long
enough at stations for them to install their stoves
on the platform, and cook a good dish of rice.</p>

<p class='c011' >Most trains have first-, second-, and third-class
carriages. Europeans and Americans usually
travel first-class, for the best in India is bad
enough when compared with the luxuries of
travel in Western countries. Most of the carriages
are about half as long as those in America,
and divided into two compartments without
a corridor, each having a lavatory at one end.
Running along each side of the compartment, just
under the windows, is a long, leather-covered
bench, which serves as a seat during the day, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
a berth at night. It is equally uncomfortable in
both capacities. Above this, folded up against
the side of the car, is a leather-covered shelf that
lets down to form the upper berth.</p>

<p class='c011' >My first experience in Indian trains was at
night. My turbaned servant arranged my bedding
on a bench in a compartment reserved for
ladies, switched on an electric fan, salaamed, and
went off to find his place in a servants' compartment
adjoining. Most trains have special compartments
for servants. It is impossible to travel
comfortably in India without native servants.</p>

<p class='c011' >While I was in the dressing-room, preparing
for the night, I heard a noise outside, and, looking
out, saw an old man with a lantern, down on
his knees looking under the berths. He said that
he was looking for me, that he was afraid I had
missed the train.</p>

<p class='c011' >Finally, after a great ringing of bells, tooting
of whistles, waving of lanterns, and chattering
of natives, we pulled out into the darkness and
heat. The electric fan burred, mosquitos
hummed and bit, the train rocked wildly from
side to side.</p>

<p class='c011' >I was just dozing off, when lights were flashed
in my eyes. More bells, whistles, and chattering
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
natives! The door burst open, and an Englishman
ordered his man to put his luggage in the
compartment. I called out that it was reserved
for ladies, and he disappeared with a "Sorry!"</p>

<p class='c011' >Out into the darkness again, only to be aroused
at the next station by the guard, who shouted,
"Tickets, please!" The night was one prolonged
nightmare of heat, noise, jolting, and mosquitos.
By five, I was beginning to sleep, when I was
startled by a cry of "<i>Chota Hazree!</i>" I sat up
in alarm, wondering what those dreadful-sounding
words could mean, when the shutters by my
head were suddenly lowered, and a tray of toast
and tea thrust in at me. I accepted it, and gave
up all idea of sleep. The dreadful-sounding
words, I found, meant "little breakfast."</p>

<p class='c011' >Sometimes we had our meals from a tiffin
basket which we carried with us, sometimes from
a restaurant car, or again at the station café while
the train waited, and sometimes, when all of these
failed us, not at all. During the winter, traveling
was more comfortable. It was so cold that
we needed heavy rugs over us. Some of the express-trains
go from twenty to thirty miles an
hour.</p>

<p class='c011' >Each time that the train stops, there is great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
confusion. The natives arrive at the station
hours ahead of time. Here they squat patiently
until the train arrives, when they quite lose their
heads. In an attempt to find places in the
crowded carriages, they run excitedly up and
down the platform, clinging to one another,
clutching at their clumsy luggage, and screaming
at their servants and the trainmen. Equally agitated
groups pour out of the cars and scurry off
to find bullock carts or <i>ekkas</i> to drive them to the
town, which is usually some distance from the
station. Boys and women with sweets, fruit,
drinking-water, toys, cheap jewelry, and various
articles of native production cry their wares at
the car windows. Others sell newspapers, which
are apt to be weeks old, if the purchaser does not
insist upon seeing the date. The platform
presents a riot of strange costumes, bright colors,
quick-moving figures with jingling bangles and
ankles, unholy odors, and clamorous sounds.</p>

<p class='c011' >At the stations, we were met in different parts
of India by the greatest imaginable variety of
conveyances&mdash;carriages with footmen and drivers
in state livery, sent by the native princes, hotel
and public carriages after models never dreamed
of in America, bullock carts, elephants, camels,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
rickshaws, and, in Calcutta and Bombay, taxi-automobiles.</p>

<p class='c011' >When your driver starts off down the street at
a reckless gait, clanging a bell in the floor of the
carriage with his foot, and a boy on a step at the
back calls out "<i>Tahvay!</i>" as you bowl along, you
wonder if you have not taken, by mistake, a police
wagon or an ambulance. But it is all right; you
hear the same shouting and clanging of bells
from all the other carriages along the route.
This noise is necessary to make the idlers who
stroll along the streets hand in hand get out of the
way of the carriages.</p>

<p class='c011' >There are so many horses in India that one
wonders why any one should ever walk, and, in
fact, very few do. They are of all grades, differing
as much as does the shabbiest beggar from
the most gorgeous raja. The conveyances to
which they are harnessed range from the rickety
public ekkas to the royal gold and silver coaches
used on state occasions. One sees these wretched-looking
public carriages that can be hired for
a few cents filled with lazy natives and pulled
along by a poor little pony that looks as if it were
half-starved. Contrasting with these poor over-worked
creatures are the thoroughbreds which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
literally die in the stables of the princes for lack
of exercise.</p>

<p class='c011' >When we were visiting in the native states, the
chiefs sometimes offered us saddle-horses. The
first time I rode one of these, I started off gaily,
nothing fearing. From a gentle canter my
mount suddenly broke into a dead run. Supposing
that horses in all countries understood the
same language, I said "Whoa," first mildly, persuasively,
then loudly, imploringly; but without
the slightest effect. On he sped faster and
faster, until he overtook another horse, apparently
a friend of his, for he slowed down to a
walk beside it. I learned afterward that a sound
similar to that used in America to make a horse
go is used in India to make him stop. So the
poor dear did not understand in the least my
frantic cries of "Whoa!"</p>

<p class='c011' >The only other swift-moving animal that it was
my misfortune to encounter in India was a camel.
This was in the north, in the desert of Rajputana.
We were going to visit some tombs about five
miles from the city. The others went in carriages,
but I preferred to try the "fleet-footed
camel." The creature knelt docilely enough to
let me climb into the saddle back of the driver;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
then he unfolded his many-jointed legs and rose,
throwing me forward and backward in a most uncomfortable
manner.</p>

<p class='c011' >He walked haughtily about the grounds of the
guest-house a few minutes, turning up his nose at
everybody, then suddenly let his hind legs collapse,
almost throwing me off. The driver succeeded
in making him understand that there was
no use making a fuss, that he would have to take
us. Off across the desert he started, at a gait so
rough that I know of nothing with which to compare
it. At first, I tried to hold to the saddle, but
it was too slippery, so there was nothing to do
but to throw my arms about the driver, and hang
on to him with all my might. I returned in a carriage!</p>

<p class='c011' >At Mysore and several other places, we saw
camel-carriages. They make a queer sight, these
ungainly, loose-jointed animals shambling along
in the harness. In Bikanir, we watched the
camel corps drill. The natives in this part of
India are very finely built men, and they look most
imposing in their gaily colored uniforms and
turbans as they sit erect on the arrogant camels
who snub even their masters.</p>

<p class='c011' >There are so many slow, lazy ways of traveling
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
in India that it is difficult to say which is the slowest.</p>

<p class='c011' >Perhaps the bullocks, when they walk, are the
slowest of all. They do, however, sometimes
trot, and that at a rather brisk pace. They are
beautiful animals, and very different from those
in America. Their skin is wonderfully soft and
silky. Between their shoulders is a large gristly
hump. From their chin down between their fore
legs hangs a loose, flabby fold of skin.</p>

<p class='c011' >Of these, the most beautiful are the huge white
bulls sacred to the Hindu god Shiva. These lead
a life of leisure and luxury. They roam about
the streets unmolested, eating from the fruit- and
vegetable-stalls at will. Some are housed in the
temples of the god.</p>

<p class='c011' >Those who are not so lucky as to be held sacred
have a rather hard time of it. They do most of
the heavy hauling, and often suffer very cruel
treatment from their drivers. In fact, no other
animal is so much the victim of the cruelty and
ignorance of the natives as these poor bullocks.</p>

<p class='c011' >We drove in all sorts of curious-looking conveyances
behind these somewhat refractory creatures.
Once we drove out into a desolate region
to visit some deserted temples, seated on the floor
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
of a bullock cart with an arched cover of plaited
bamboo over us. The men along the road walked
faster than our bullocks, which went so slowly
that, had it not been for the jolting of the cart, we
should scarcely have known that we were moving.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the southernmost part of the peninsula,
along the Malabar coast, where there are no
trains, we traveled in cabin-boats rowed by
natives. It took them all night to row from
Quilan to Travandrum, about fifty miles along
the backwater. They sang from the moment
they began to row, timing the stroke of the oar
to the rhythm of their song. In the morning,
they appeared as smiling and fresh as they had
the evening before when we started.</p>

<p class='c011' >In Madras, we rode in rickshaws like those of
China and Japan. In many parts of India, men
take the place of animals, both in carrying people
and in transporting cargo. Several times we
were carried up mountains in <i>dholies</i> by coolies.
These dholies consist of a seat swung between
two poles by ropes. They are carried by two or
four men, who trot off up the hill with the poles
resting on their shoulders, while the passenger
dangles between them. They used to come down
the mountains so fast that we were quite terrified.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
The seat would twist and sway, hit against trees,
graze along the side of rocks, while our porters
would dance along, talking and laughing, without
paying the slightest attention to us. Then
there are various kinds of push-carts used in different
parts of the country.</p>

<p class='c011' >Of course, the really Indian way of traveling
is on elephants. Very few, however, except
princes and foreign travelers, ever ride on these
lordly animals. In the "zoos" in Calcutta and
Bombay there are elephants for the children to
ride. The riders climb steps to a platform the
height of the elephant's back, then jump into the
howdah, where they are tied fast to make sure of
their not falling. The old <i>huthi</i>, as the elephant
is called there, sways off, waving his trunk, flopping
his ears, and blinking his eyes. He makes
a tour of the gardens, then returns to the platform
to get other children.</p>

<p class='c011' >At Jaipur, Gwalior, and a number of other
towns where there is a fort on a hill, elephants
can be hired for the ascension. The huge creatures
knelt down while we clambered into the
howdah with the aid of ladders. When they
rose, it seemed like an earthquake to us on their
backs. They climbed the hill so slowly that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
others of the party who walked arrived ahead of
us. Our huthi would smell about carefully with
his trunk before taking each step, then he would
put a huge foot forward cautiously, and throw
his great weight upon it slowly, as if afraid that
the earth would give way under him. It took
him so long to accommodate his four feet to each
step, that I was thankful he had not as many as a
centiped.</p>

<p class='c011' >To appreciate an elephant in all his glory, one
should see him in the splendor of princely procession.
Designs in bright colors are painted on
his forehead and trunk, trappings of silver ornament
his tusks, head, and ankles, a rich cloth of
gold and silver embroidery hangs over his colossal
sides, and on his back is perched a rare howdah,
often of gold and silver, with silk hangings.
Aloft in the howdah rides the prince, resplendent
with gold, silk, and jewels. In front, on the
elephant's neck, sits the mahout, urging him on
with strange-sounding grunts, and prods from a
short pointed spear.</p>

<p class='c011' >The elephants are reserved for state occasions.
Most of the princes now have automobiles, which
they look upon much as a child does its latest toy.
The mass of the people depend upon the bullocks
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
and horses to cart them about. There are now,
also, in most parts of the empire, telephones and
telegraphs; but they are such ancient systems and
so unreliable that they are not to be compared
with ours. India is through and through a lazy
country, where nobody is in a hurry.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010' >In Montana, Idaho, and northern Wyoming
lies the region where center the headwaters
of the Missouri, Yellowstone, Green, and Snake
rivers&mdash;the last named a branch of the Columbia.
In the early years of the last century it was
virtually the center of all human activity in the
Rocky Mountain region, being a prolific, but dangerous,
trapping-ground for the fur trade of
those days.</p>

<p class='c011' >Here the cloud-piercing peaks of the American
Rockies reach their greatest altitude, and the
scenery is of the wildest and most impressive
character. The Grand Teton, 13,747 feet elevation,
overlooking the magnificent Jackson Lake
basin, has been climbed but twice by white men.</p>

<p class='c011' >Since the Yellowstone Park was established, in
1872, the wonders of this region have been more
or less familiar. But prior to 1870 they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
believed to exist largely in the fertile imagination
of the trapper.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Park region, as we will call it, lay between
the old-time northern and southern routes of
frontier-day travel across the continent. It is
true there were Indian trails leading across and
through it, but the Indians, superstitious by
nature, seem to have avoided the localities of the
geysers and hot springs, and their north and
south bound trails lay to the east or west of these
areas that now fascinate and interest us.</p>

<p class='c011' >In 1807, along one of these outside trails&mdash;one
that just skirted the eastern side of the geyser
zone, which here lies along a well-defined north-and-south
axis&mdash;came the first white man who
visited the region. He saw the two beautiful
lakes, Jackson and Yellowstone, the dazzling
Grand Cañon and its two falls, probably some of
the hot springs, and possibly some of the inferior
geysers. His trail is shown&mdash;marked "Colter's
Route in 1807"&mdash;on the map of the great explorers
Lewis and Clark in 1814. But it was
after their return to civilization that they learned
of this "hot springs brimstone" locality.</p>

<p class='c011' >John Colter was a prince of adventurers. His
life as a border hero, explorer, and trapper rivals
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
that of any character of fiction; his discovery of
the Yellowstone, while on a mission to an Indian
tribe, was purely accidental, but it brought him
lasting fame. He, himself, probably never realized
its importance.</p>

<p class='c011' >Two or three other old-time and adventurous
mountaineers, particularly James, or "Jim,"
Bridger, afterward visited this locality, but people
in general utterly refused seriously to consider,
let alone believe, what these men told them regarding
it.</p>

<p class='c011' >Bridger was a man of remarkable ability as a
guide and mountaineer, although unable to read,
or even to write his own name. He was the discoverer
of Great Salt Lake, and as a guide and
natural-born scout had no superior, if, indeed, an
equal, among frontiersmen. In this capacity he
served numerous government and other expeditions
and explored and traversed a large part of
what was then the Far West. He could tell many
a good story about his hairbreadth escapes, and
lived to a ripe old age.</p>

<p class='c011' >To attempt a word-picture of this region and
its weird and unusual features is almost useless,
and yet every one who visits it endeavors to do
so. No words can be found adequately to describe
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
the hot springs, that are numbered by the
thousands, and the marvelous hues of their
waters and their basins, rimmed and ornamented
by fluted and beaded parapets of indescribable
delicacy and beauty. Nor can the geysers, leaping
suddenly from their deep, nether-world reservoirs,
be pictured by words in such a way as to
convey to the mind a real image of their strange
and fascinating reality.</p>

<p class='c011' >The first printed description of one of them
was by another trapper, Warren A. Ferris, of the
old American Fur Company. He visited a geyser
area in 1834, but his account of it was not
published until July, 1842.</p>

<p class='c011' >Numerous waterfalls are found here, from cascades
a few feet in height to cataracts having
twice the leap of Niagara; lakes lie deeply embosomed
among the high peaks or the heavy
forests, and one of them, twenty miles in length
and a mile and a half above the ocean, is now
being navigated&mdash;think of it!&mdash;by motor-boats;
thousands of miles of crystal trout-streams, kept
supplied with trout by the government hatcheries,
radiate in every direction; a natural glass cliff, an
Indian quarry for arrow-heads in the ancient
days, towers above a lake formed at its base by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
the wise and cunning beavers. There is, too, a
low mountain of pure sulphur, with beautiful
boiling sulphur-pools splashing at its foot; and,
in contrast to these, there is a gruesome volcano
of mud belching from a dark, malodorous cavern,
while almost beside this is a beautiful, clear pool
of hot water formed by a stream flowing from beneath
a green Gothic arch.</p>

<p class='c011' >The wonderful cañons, exhibiting such different
phases of nature's sublime handiwork, awe
the beholder. One shows the marvelous way in
which lava, cooling, arranges itself in massive,
black, symmetric slabs and columns; these enclose
a beautiful fall that adds a touch of lightness and
beauty. The Grand Cañon is the most startling
and extraordinary example of color harmony and
nature sculpture to be found in the universe. A
Japanese, in the poetic imagery of his race, has
said that these brilliant cañon walls have caught
and emblazoned upon their mural precipices the
sunsets of all the yesterdays&mdash;a beautiful conception.
One stands awed to silence in the presence
of "Nature's immensities" seen here and is almost
overwhelmed by the profound splendors and
majestic glories of this cañon.</p>

<p class='c011' >In another respect this park land stands in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
category by itself. By federal enactment all of
the Yellowstone Park proper and some additional
territory bordering it has been made a vast national
game-preserve, something not originally
planned.</p>

<p class='c011' >As settlement has increased and the valleys
have become occupied by farmers and ranchmen,
the game has been forced into the higher valleys
and parks of the mountains, or into their remote
recesses. Here, within the park boundaries,
deer, elk, antelope, bears, mountain-sheep, moose,
bison, and the smaller game, birds (between 150
and 200 species), and fur-bearing animals, have
a refuge where no hunter or trapper penetrates
and danger rarely intrudes. In the Jackson Lake
country, hunting is allowed for a limited period.</p>

<p class='c011' >There are thousands of these various animals
that know they are absolutely immune from
harm by man when within the bounds of this
park. Most of them have never seen a dog nor
heard the sound of a rifle. Under these conditions
their natural timidity is greatly lessened,
and many of them, even bears, become surprisingly
tame.</p>

<p class='c011' >From the supply which Yellowstone Park
affords, state and city parks and various game-preserves
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
are being stocked. Experienced men
round up the yearling elk into corrals near the
railway sidings, and there load them into freight-cars,
with plenty of alfalfa hay, and then they are
forwarded to their destination. Many carloads
are shipped each winter.</p>

<p class='c011' >The writer recently visited the park in winter
to see the game animals. Heavy snows covering
their pastures drive them down from their high
ranges to the lower hills, cañons, and draws about
Gardiner and Mammoth Hot Springs, and here
the Government, during times of storm and
stress, feeds them alfalfa hay and thus saves
them from starvation. Elk by hundreds, or even
thousands, dot the hillsides,&mdash;there are from
30,000 to 40,000 of them by actual count,&mdash;while
antelope in goodly numbers range on the open and
lower hill-slopes. In Gardiner Cañon beside the
road the beautiful mule-deer and the white-tailed
deer, touchingly innocent and trustful, and the
mountain-sheep&mdash;the big-horn fellows&mdash;stand or
lie, eating alfalfa, and enjoying the protecting
care of a beneficent, animal-loving government.
They become almost as domesticated as barn-yard
animals. Indeed, at Mammoth Hot Springs, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
deer actually haunt the kitchen doors and rear
themselves on their hind legs against the porch
railings, or even climb the steps and peer into the
doors and windows, mutely begging for food,
which they often take from one's hand. At night
they lie on the snow under the large trees, or, in
some cases, even sleep in the large cavalry-barns,
which have been vacant since the soldiers were removed
from the park in the fall of 1916.</p>

<p class='c011' >Over at the bison range and corral on Lamar
River, in the northeastern corner of the park, one
sees an interesting sight. Here the mountain
scenery of the park reaches its finest development.
In summer or winter the ride to the corral from
Mammoth Hot Springs is a treat. In summer
the bison herd of about three hundred&mdash;there is
a so-called wild herd of about a hundred some
miles farther south&mdash;ranges in a beautiful valley
and on the adjoining hills and mountain-slopes
near the Petrified Forest and Death Gulch. It
is under the care of a keeper who lives here with
his family, in a comfortable home provided by the
Government. The bison are rounded up at intervals
during the summer so that their condition
and whereabouts shall be always known. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
herd originally consisted of only twenty-one animals,
purchased by the Government in 1902 at a
cost of $15,000.</p>

<p class='c011' >In January, 1917, I made a trip by sleigh,
drawn by a pair of sturdy horses, to the bison
corral. On the hills at intervals along the entire
route large bands of elk were to be seen. The
snow was more than two feet deep, and it required
two days, mostly at a walk, to travel the
thirty-five miles between Gardiner and the corral.
The thermometer registered from ten to fifteen
degrees below zero, and for the week following
the mercury ranged, in the morning, from thirty-two
to fifty degrees below.</p>

<p class='c011' >In winter the bison are kept in a large pasture-corral
a square mile in extent, lying along Rose
Creek and Lamar River, and here they remain
very contentedly. Long before daylight each
morning the herd congregates about the corral
gate, waiting for feeding-time. Soon after daylight
a sleigh is driven into the inclosure, loaded
with alfalfa hay and drawn by a pair of horses
that have become so accustomed to the buffalo as
to pay no attention to them, even though the latter
crowd close about them. The hay is pitch-forked
to the ground as the sleigh is slowly driven
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
along, and the animals line themselves out, following
it until all are supplied. In an hour or
two, after they have eaten their fill, they "mosey"
over to the steaming creek that has its sources in
some hot springs in the hills, drink slowly and
long, and then sedately walk back along deep
trails in the snow, the mother bison followed by
their calves, to the feeding-ground, where most
of them then lie down and sleep for a good part
of the day. Mock fights or hunting jousts are
indulged in by some of the younger animals and
afford variety and amusement, to the participants
at least. In the dim light of a winter morning
the animals resemble a herd of young elephants.</p>

<p class='c011' >Reference has been made to the fact that this
particular locality is especially interesting from a
geographical standpoint. Including the Jackson
Lake country it is in this respect one of the most
important and interesting regions on the continent.
It lies on both sides of the great Continental
Divide, which twists and turns in all directions
in its course northward and southward.</p>

<p class='c011' >Outside of the limits of Yellowstone Park itself,
the mountain structure found here is, perhaps,
not greatly different from that of other
parts of the Rockies. The Teton range lies south
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
of the park, and is one of the most prominent and
commanding in the entire Rocky Mountain chain.
The park region itself seems to be a vent for the
pent-up heat of the earth. It is not improbable
that these boiling springs and geysers may serve
as escape-valves, and be the means of preventing
very serious volcanic disturbances, such as occurred
here in past ages.</p>

<p class='c011' >As a watershed the region is equally remarkable.
It has been noted that here four of the
largest rivers of our country have their sources,
interlacing with one another. It is, indeed, a network
of thousands of mountain streams forming,
ultimately, four great rivers, each flowing to a
different point of the compass. The headwaters
of the Snake River, joining with the Columbia,
find their way into the North Pacific Ocean. The
waters of the Green, after a journey through the
great cañons of the Southwest, flow into the
Pacific through the Gulf of California. To the
east flows the Yellowstone, which merges its
waters with those of the Missouri, and, after a
journey of three thousand miles, flows into the
Atlantic through the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p class='c011' >This unique region is no longer difficult of access.
Railways reach it from three sides, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
north, west, and east, and the Government has
spent between one million and two million dollars
in establishing excellent roads to enable travelers
to view the beauties of the Yellowstone. Here is
to be found the finest automobile trip of its length
in the country, supplemented by telephone-lines
and large and costly hotels. The construction of
these buildings must be carried on in winter, and
the nails used have to be heated in order to handle
them.</p>

<p class='c011' >With the year 1917 will disappear the last
remnant of the old stage-coaching days, a mode
of travel which for years was the only method of
land travel in the West, and which until now has
been the method of transportation in the park.
Beginning with this season, automobiles will displace
the horses and coaches and numerous other
changes in the way of increased comfort, convenience,
and pleasure have been planned. The
old six-day now becomes one of five days, with
several advantageous changes in route and in the
time to be spent at different points.</p>

<p class='c011' >The policy of our Government in establishing
these national parks has since been followed by
other nations, and it has been praised by such
thoughtful observers as, for example, Lord Bryce,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
ex-ambassador to this country from England.
That it has accomplished the object of its originators
and is a blessing to mankind is now beyond
question.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>FIRECRACKERS</span><br /> <br />BY ERICK POMEROY<br /> <br />TEMPLE OF THE EMPRESS OF HEAVEN, CHINA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >This is the thirteenth day of the fifth moon
of the thirty-third year of Kwang-su, very
early in the morning&mdash;that is, "very early" for
me, because I ordered my "boy" last evening
to call me at eight o'clock this morning and not a
minute before. Here, in the rambling old temple
where we live, we have learned to go to bed with
the sun on the fourteenth and on the last day of
each Chinese moon, because we know that the
wailing pipes of the early morning celebrations
before the gods on the first and fifteenth of the
moon will be certain to wake us at a truly heathenish
hour. But when an extra, unannounced,
unexpected festival day is ushered in with cymbals,
pipes, and firecrackers, then we just have to
lose our morning sleep and try not to lose our
tempers. This morning is one of those dawns
of misery. Even as I write the temple bells, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
drums, and those peculiar jig-time horns are setting
up a discordant hubbub in the courtyards,
while at intervals a big cracker sends me springing
into the air with a start that fearfully tries
my nerves. At first this morning I endeavored
to sleep, but I soon gave that up to don my kimono
and sally forth to find out the cause of this gratuitous
Fourth of July. Out on the terrace in front
of the inner gates of the temple, to which the rays
of the rising sun had not yet bent down, there
was gathered a small group of men and boys
watching such a display of firecrackers as would
have attracted a whole City Hall Park full of
people at home. Yet their interest was apparently
much like their numbers&mdash;very small.
They just gazed at the exploding end of the red
string of noise without any comments and without
any more evident interest than they took in
seeing that the small boys picked up all of the
unexploded crackers that were blown out of the
danger circle by their more powerful brothers.
My appearance in a kimono and straw sandals
seemed to furnish them with more excitement
than the rope of crackers which hung from the
firecrackers pole hard by. Such a din! Can you
imagine a string of firecrackers, large and small
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
woven together, of over one hundred thousand?</p>

<p class='c011' >But I am getting ahead of my story. By way
of introduction I meant only to tell you that I
have for some time been planning to write a letter
to your good editor in the hope that he might
be willing to pass on to you of the fast-disappearing
American "firecracker age" my story of how
this country, the native land of the "whip-guns,"
manufactures and uses these crackers which we
think of as belonging only to our Fourth of July.</p>

<p class='c011' >The desire and determination to write this letter
had their birth one day in a city of North
China when I was walking along the street where
many of the firecracker-makers live&mdash;since dubbed
"Firecracker Row" on my private chart of the
city&mdash;and when I suddenly realized how much I
should have liked as a boy, when I was "shooting
off crackers," to see these places and to know
their ways of manufacture. It is difficult not to
be interrupted nor to interrupt these lines. Now
there are two little pigtailed heads stretched up
just over my window-sill, peeping in and asking
if I do not wish to buy the tiger-lilies they have
gathered on the hillside. So first I will try to tell
you how the crackers are made and then how
they are used out here, in the hope that you may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
find as much interest in reading the story as I
have found in gathering the information and pictures
for it.</p>

<p class='c011' >Several times I went into the city to visit Firecracker
Row, and on one occasion took a series
of photographs to show more clearly than words
will do the important steps in the process of manufacture.
The first step consists in cutting the
rough brown paper into pieces long enough to
make a hollow tube of several layers in thickness,
and wide enough to give the tube a length just
twice that of the finished cracker. From the top
of his pile the workman takes a pack of these
slips, lays them out with one end arranged just
like steps, and then slides down the stairs, as it
were, with a brush of paste, so as to make the
outer ends of the slips stick fast when rolled
against the tube. Then he bends the other&mdash;the
dry&mdash;end around an iron nail, and places the nail
under a board, which rolls it along the slip until
all the paper has curled around it. Once the
cracker skeleton is thus formed, he gives it an
extra roll or two down the bench for good measure,
slides it off the nail into a basket, and has
another started before you realize what he is
about. Then one of the small apprentices in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
shop arranges the skeletons together in a six-sided
bundle, like those on the drying board in
Cut II, in each of which he puts just five hundred
and seven. Why that particular number, I could
not find out.</p>

<p class='c011' >Once dry, the skeletons receive their covering
garment of red paper, which makes them so truly
"little redskins"&mdash;this from the hands of one of
the workers without the aid of any machine whatever.
He just rolls one of the narrow slips
around the tube with his fingers and hurries the
growing agitator into another basket to await the
time for stuffing in the material that will make
him such a lively fellow. Once more, however,
they all have to be packed up into the six-sided
bundles, this time with two stout strings tied
around them a third of the way from the top and
bottom, leaving the middle free. The worker
takes his big knife and chops right down through
the whole bundle to make the clean ends for the
tops of the shorter tubes.</p>

<p class='c011' >These shorter tubes next have a thin paper covering
pasted over both tops and bottoms before
the bottoms are closed by tapping them with a
nail that is just a little larger than the hole in the
tube, so that it crowds down some of the paper
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
from the sides. With the bundles right side up,
the workman then makes holes in the paper cover
over the top, scatters on this the powder dust, and
distributes it fairly evenly among the five hundred
and seven hungry ones by means of a light brush.
When the dust has been tamped a little, the powder
finds its way to the middle of the tube in the
same manner, the fuse is inserted by another
workman, the top layer of dust added, and the
whole supply of bottled fun packed in by another
tamping with a nail and mallet. Completed and
still crowded together in the bundles, the little
redskins, with the fuses sticking out of their caps,
seem to wear a festive, promising look that clearly
says: "You give us a light, and we'll do the rest.
And what a high old time it will be!"</p>

<p class='c011' >When asked how many of these bundles one
man could make in a day, the good-natured master
of the shop said that one man is counted on
to make twenty bundles up to the point where the
powder is put in, when the crackers are passed
along to others to finish and weave into strings.
What a "string" means here in this land, where
the diminutive "packs" we used to buy for a nickel
would be scored, may be gathered from a glance
at those which the maker is holding up in Cut I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
and at those on the drying-boards in the view
shown in Cut II.</p>

<p class='c011' >Once the crackers have been fully prepared for
stringing, either they are put together in such
strings as you see in the pictures or they have bigger
fellows&mdash;four or five times the size of the
little ones&mdash;plaited in at regular intervals. Then
they are wrapped neatly with red or white paper
in long packages bearing on the face a red slip
with the shop's name printed on it in gilt characters.
Some of these packets would have
seemed monstrous&mdash;needlessly extravagant&mdash;in
those days when I used to make one or two nickel
packs last the better part of a Fourth of July
morning by firing them one by one in a hole in the
tie-post or under a tin can. To give these longer
strings sufficient strength to hang from a pole, as
is the usual way of firing them, the workmen
weave in with the fuses a light piece of hemp
twine. But even this is not an adequate protection
against a break in those monster strings that
come out on special occasions. The one that
started this letter to you was fifteen feet long
when I arrived on the scene to investigate the disturbance
and had already lost one-half its numbers
(I have seen strings from thirty to fifty feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
long). To keep such a string from breaking, the
Chinese fasten it at intervals to a rope which runs
through the pulley at the top of the pole, and then
draw the line up until the bottom clears the
ground. As the explosions tear away the lowest
crackers, the rope is let down and, at the same
time, held out away from the bottom of the pole
to make a graceful curve of the last few feet of
the string. When such long strings have eaten
themselves up, you can imagine the amount of
fragments around the base of the pole. There
are literally basketfuls of them to be first wetted
down to guard against fire and then swept up or
allowed to blow away when the winds so will.</p>

<p class='c011' >Thus far you have heard only of little and big
crackers. However, there are many distinguishing
names among the Chinese for the several varieties
and sizes, which I am going to give you
before passing on to the story of the special uses
of crackers in the Chinese life. First come the
ordinary <i>pien p'ao</i>, or "whip-guns," the small
ones which derive their name from the similarity
which their explosion bears to the snapping of a
whip. Sometimes they are called simply "whips,"
in the same way that the Chinese speak of many
things by shortened or changed names. To make
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
these names seem more real to you I have had
my Chinese teacher write out for me on separate
slips the characters which represent them.
More diminutive than the ordinary crackers are
the "small whips," about an inch long, that are
made especially for the small children to use without
danger. For one American cent you could
buy about one hundred of these. Then above the
whip-guns the next class is the "bursting bamboos,"
which are said to have taken their name
from the fact that in early times bamboo was used
as the tubes for these crackers. If such were the
case, a line of them must have "made the splinters
fly." Even still more powerful are the "hemp
thunderers," or, to take a little liberty with the
translation, the "hemp sons of thunder," whose
name also indicates their construction and their
magnitude. Bearing a close similarity in power
to our cannon crackers, these have been known at
times to break the second-story paper windows
in a small compound. They play an important
part in the worshiping, or propitiating of the gods
in our courtyard, inasmuch as it is considered
good form to set them off at intervals while the
whip-guns&mdash;which my teacher assures me "do
not require any watching"&mdash;are keeping up their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
unbroken stream of praise and prayer. They
may be considered as good lusty "Amens"
throughout the service.</p>

<p class='c011' >Slightly different in form are the "double
noises," which are nothing more or less than our
"boosters" that go off first on the ground and
again up in the air. To intersperse these
throughout the explosions of the whips during
any special demonstration is also considered good
form. Then allied to these we find another
booster, which when it explodes on the ground
drives ten others up into the air to become the
"flying in heaven ten sounds" with the Chinese.
These are only "for play," and that chiefly in the
homes from the thirteenth to the seventeenth days
of the first moon of the year. With the "lamp
flower exploders," that is, our flower-pot, the list
of the most common forms of crackers and fire-works
becomes exhausted, although the Chinese
have several other less usual species, together
with many alternative names for both these and
the ones I have mentioned.</p>

<img src='images/illus3b.jpg' alt='' class='ig005' />
<p>Hexagonal bundles of firecrackers<br />drying in the sun</p>
</div>

<p class='c011' >The time when the Chinese receive most crackers
is at the New Year season, when, among the
well-to-do families of Tientsin and Peking, it is
customary to give a boy the equivalent of our fifty
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
cents for his purchases. In Peking the shops
issue special red notes, like our old "shinplasters"
in value, for this one use at the New Year. In
giving the cracker money to the boys, the parents
often make smaller presents to the girls, who are
wont to buy paper flowers with their pennies, in
proof of which the Chinese have a proverb which
runs, "Girls like flowers; boys like crackers."</p>

<p class='c011' >But this juvenile use of the whip-guns consumes
only an infinitesimal part of the whole supply
of the year. At many festivals and on many
occasions the head of the house, the manager of
the shop, or the officers of the gild require great
quantities of these propitious harbingers. Greatest
of all occasions is the passing of the year,
when the people keep up the successor to the
ancient custom of setting off the "bamboo guns"
in order to drive away the evil spirits of the past
twelvemonth and to usher in all that is good for
the coming one. All night long the crackers have
been popping in the town below, and an early
gathering in the temple is held to add the final
touch before the new day shall break.</p>

<p class='c011' >When morning came, I wandered leisurely to
my office through the business section of the town
to watch the fun at the big shops. Never shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
I forget the picture of that street with its dozen
or more great red strings of crackers hanging in
front of the bigger hongs and seemingly waiting
for some word to start the fusillade. Fortunately
this came and the storm broke as I waited.
For sheer noise, vivacity, and demonstrative liveliness
I never have seen the equal of those snarling,
bursting lines that poured out their wrath
with incessant fervor upon the evil spirits below
and shot up their welcome to the good ones above.
Then, although this display on New Year's Day
seemed grand enough to last a long time, there
came more explosions as the shops took down
their doors and began their routine business on
the fifth or sixth of the moon. Furthermore,
custom demands in certain parts that throughout
the first ten days of the year there shall be occasional
snappings of the whips, to be followed
on the fifteenth, at the Feast of Lanterns, by a
still greater demonstration.</p>

<p class='c011' >When a new shop is opened, it is customary
for all the front boards to be left up until just
before the opening ceremony takes place; then
one or two boards are taken down, the manager
and his assistants come out to light a string of
crackers, and, as the whips are snapping, the remaining
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
boards come down to the sound of this
propitious music of the land. Very often there
are several strings hung from poles or tripods,
and one is lighted after the other in such a way
as to maintain a long, unbroken stream of noise.</p>

<p class='c011' >In most parts of the empire it is also customary
for an official, when he receives the seals of office
from his predecessor, to have a string of crackers
let off at the proper moment. And I must confess
to having yielded myself to the pressure of
my Chinese assistants in having purchased a few
for use at the time we opened our new office at
this place. Likewise, when a military official is
leaving a post, he is usually accorded a send-off
with crackers which have been subscribed for by
his men.</p>

<p class='c011' >And thus, from what has gone before, you may
catch some idea of the persistency with which the
little redskins have poked their noses into almost
all the important celebrations of the Chinese life.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>CURIOUS CLOCKS</span><br /> <br />BY CHARLES A. BRASSLER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Many of the German cities of the Middle
Ages enjoyed great prosperity, which they
liked to exhibit in the form of splendid churches
and other public buildings; and each one tried to
excel the others. When, therefore, in the year
1352, Strassburg was the first to erect a great
cathedral clock, which not only showed the hour
to hundreds of observers, but whose strokes proclaimed
it far and near, there was a rivalry among
the rich cities as to which should set up within its
walls the most beautiful specimen of this kind.</p>

<p class='c011' >The citizens of Nuremberg, who were renowned
all over the European world for their
skill, were particularly jealous of Strassburg's
precedence over them.</p>

<p class='c011' >In 1356, when the Imperial Council, or Reichstag,
held in Nuremberg, issued the Golden Bull,
an edict or so-called "imperial constitution" which
promised to be of greatest importance to the welfare
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
of the kingdom, a locksmith, whose name is
unfortunately not recorded, took this as his idea
for the decoration of a clock which was set up in
the Frauenkirche in the year 1361. The emperor,
Charles IV, was represented, seated upon
a throne; at the stroke of twelve, the seven Electors,
large moving figures, passed and bowed before
him to the sound of trumpets.</p>

<p class='c011' >This work of art made a great sensation.</p>

<p class='c011' >Other European cities, naturally, desired to
have similar sights, and large public clocks were
therefore erected in Breslau in 1368, in Rouen
in 1389, in Metz in 1391, in Speyer in 1395, in
Augsburg in 1398, in Lübeck in 1405, in Magdeburg
in 1425, in Padua in 1430, in Dantzic in
1470, in Prague in 1490, in Venice in 1495, and
in Lyons in 1598.</p>

<p class='c011' >Not all, of course, were as artistic as that of
Nuremberg; but no town now contented itself
with a simple clockwork to tell the hours. Some
had a stroke for the hours, and some had chimes;
the one showed single characteristic moving figures,
while others were provided with great astronomical
works, showing the day of the week,
month, and year, the phases of the moon, the
course of the planets, and the signs of the zodiac.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
On the town clock of Compiègne, which was
built in 1405, three figures of soldiers, or "jaquemarts,"
so-called (in England they are called
"Jacks"), struck the hour upon three bells under
their feet; and they are doing it still. The great
clock of Dijon has a man and a woman sitting
upon an iron framework which supports the bell
upon which they strike the hours. In 1714 the
figure of a child was added, to strike the quarters.
The most popular of the mechanical figures was
the cock, flapping his wings and crowing.</p>

<p class='c011' >The clock on the Aschersleben Rathaus shows,
besides the phases of the moon, two pugnacious
goats, which butt each other at each stroke of the
hour; also the wretched Tantalus, who at each
stroke opens his mouth and tries to seize a golden
apple which floats down; but in the same moment
it is carried away again. On the Rathaus clock
in Jena is also a representation of Tantalus, opening
his mouth as in Aschersleben; but here the
apple is not present, and the convulsive efforts of
the figure to open the jaws wide become ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c011' >One of the first clocks with which important
astronomical works were connected is that of the
Marienkirche in Lübeck, now restored. Below,
at the height of a man's head, is the plate which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
shows the day of the week, month, etc.; these calculations
are so reliable that the extra day of
leap-year is pushed in automatically every four
years. The plate is more than three meters in
diameter. Above it is the dial, almost as large.
The numbers from 1 to 12 are repeated, so that
the hour-hand goes around the dial only once in
twenty-four hours. In the wide space between
the axis which carries the hand and the band
where the hours are marked, the fixed stars and
the course of the planets are represented. The
heavens are here shown as they appear to an observer
in Lübeck. In the old works the movement
of the planets was given incorrectly, for
they all were shown as completing a revolution
around the sun in 360 days. Of course this is
absurd. Mercury, for example, revolves once
around the sun in eighty-eight days, while Saturn
requires twenty-nine years and 166 days for one
revolution. When this astronomical clock was
repaired, some years ago, a very complicated
system of wheels had to be devised to reproduce
accurately the great difference in the movement
of the planets. The work consumed two years.
There are a great number of moving figures on
the Lübeck clock, but they are not of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
conspicuous interest. In spite of this, however,
they excite more wonder among the crowds of
tourists who are always present when the clock
strikes twelve than the really remarkable and
admirable astronomical and calendar works.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Strassburg clock has, more than all others,
an actually world-wide fame; and no traveler who
visits the beautiful old city fails to see the curious
and interesting spectacle which it offers daily at
noontime. To quote from one such visitor:
"Long before the clock strikes twelve, a crowd
has assembled in the high-arched portico of the
stately cathedral, to be sure of not missing the
right moment. Men and women of both high
and low degree, strangers and townspeople alike,
await in suspense the arrival of the twelfth hour.
The moment approaches, and there is breathless
silence. An angel lifts a scepter and strikes four
times upon a bell; another turns over an hour-glass
which he holds in the hand. A story
higher, an old man is seen to issue from a space
decorated in Gothic style; he strikes four times
with his crutch upon a bell, and disappears at the
other side, while the figure of Death lets the bone
in its hand fall slowly and solemnly, twelve times,
upon the hour-bell. In still another story of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
clock, the Saviour sits enthroned, bearing in the
left hand a banner of victory, the right hand
raised in benediction. As soon as the last stroke
of the hour has died away, the apostles appear
from an opening at the right hand of the Master.
One by one they turn and bow before Him, departing
at the other side. Christ lifts His hand
in blessing to each apostle in turn, and when the
last has disappeared, He blesses the assembled
multitude. A cock on a side tower flaps his
wings and crows three times. A murmur passes
through the crowd, and it disperses, filled with
wonder and admiration at the spectacle it has witnessed."</p>

<p class='c011' >In 1574, the Strassburg astronomical clock replaced
the older one. It was mainly the work of
Dasypodius, a famous mathematician, and it ran
until 1789. Later, the celebrated clock-maker,
Johann Baptist Schwilgué (born December 18,
1772), determined to repair it. After endless negotiations
with the church authorities, he obtained
the contract, and on October 2, 1842, the
clock, as made over, was solemnly reconsecrated.</p>

<p class='c011' >In very recent days, the clock of the City Hall
in Olmütz, also renovated, has become a rival to
that of the Strassburg Cathedral. In the year
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
1560, it was described by a traveler as a true
marvel, together with the Strassburg clock and
that of the Marienkirche in Dantzic. But as the
years passed, it was most inconceivably neglected,
and everything movable and portable about it was
carried off. Now, after repairs which have been
almost the same as constructing it anew, it works
almost faultlessly. In the lower part of the clock
is the calendar, with the day of the year, month,
and week, and the phases of the moon, together
with the astronomical plate; a story higher, a
large number of figures move around a group of
angels, and here is also a good portrait of the Empress
Maria Theresa. Still higher is an arrangement
of symbolical figures and decorations, which
worthily crowns the whole. A youth and a man,
above at the left, announce the hours and quarters
by blows of a hammer. The other figures go
through their motions at noonday. Scarcely
have the blows of the man's hammer ceased to
sound, when a shepherd boy, in another wing of
the clock, begins to play a tune; he has six different
pieces, which can be alternated. As soon
as he has finished, the chimes, sixteen bells, begin,
and the figures of St. George, of Rudolph of
Hapsburg, with a priest, and of Adam and Eve,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
appear in the left center. When they have disappeared,
the chimes ring their second melody, and
the figures of the right center appear,&mdash;the three
Kings of the East, before the enthroned Virgin,
and the Holy Family on the Flight into Egypt.
When the bells ring for the third time, all the
figures show themselves once more.</p>

<p class='c011' >Clocks operated by electricity are, of course,
the product of recent times.</p>

<p class='c011' >England's largest electric clock was, as our illustration
shows, recently christened in a novel
manner. The makers, Messrs. Gent &amp; Co., of
Leicester, entertained about seventy persons at
luncheon on this occasion, using one of the four
mammoth dials as a dining-table, a "time table,"
as the guests facetiously styled it.</p>

<p class='c011' >The clock was installed, 220 feet above the
ground, in the tower of the Royal Liverpool Society's
new building, in Liverpool. Each of the
four dials, which weigh fifteen tons together,
measure twenty-five feet in diameter, with a minute-hand
fourteen feet long. The hands are
actuated electrically by a master clock connected
with the Greenwich Observatory. After dark,
they are illuminated by electricity, and are visible
at a great distance.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
Still larger are the dials of the great electric
clock, situated 346 feet high, in the tower of the
Metropolitan Life Building, on Madison Square,
New York City. They measure twenty-six and
one half feet in diameter. The minute-hand is
seventeen feet from end to end, and twelve feet
from center to point, while the hour-hand measures
thirteen feet four inches in all, and eight feet
four inches from the center of the dial outward.
These immense hands are of iron framework,
sheathed in copper, and weigh 1000 and 700
pounds respectively.</p>

<p class='c011' >The big clock and the ninety-nine other clocks
in the building are regulated from a master clock
in the Directors' Room, on the second floor, which
sends out minute impulses, and is adjusted to run
within five seconds per month.</p>

<p class='c011' >At night, the dial, hands, and numerals are
beautifully illuminated, of which we present a
picture, the enlarged minute-hand showing the
length of exposure. The time is also flashed all
night in a novel manner from the great gilded
"lantern" at the apex of the tower, 696 feet above
the pavement. The quarter-hours are announced
from each of the four faces of the lantern by a
single red light, the halves by two red flashes, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
three quarters by three flashes. On the hour,
the white arc-lights are extinguished temporarily,
and white flashes show the number of the hour.</p>

<p class='c011' >This takes the place of the bells operated in the
daytime. They are in four tones, G (1500
pounds), F (2000 pounds), E flat (3000 pounds),
and B flat (7000 pounds), and each quarter-hour
ring out the "Westminster Chimes," in successive
bars. These are the highest chimes in the world,
being situated on the forty-second floor, 615 feet
above the street level; and they attract much attention
from visitors.</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>MOTORING THROUGH THE GOLDEN AGE&mdash;PART I</span><br /> <br />BY ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >It was some time in June when we found ourselves
drifting about Normandy in our motor-car,
and one peaceful evening we came to Bayeux
and stopped there for the night. Bayeux, which
is about sixty miles from Cherbourg, was intimately
associated with the life of William the
Conqueror, and is to-day the home of the famous
Bayeux tapestry, a piece of linen two hundred and
thirty feet long and eighteen inches wide, on
which is embroidered in colored wool the story
of William's conquest of England.</p>

<p class='c011' >William's queen, Matilda, is supposed to have
designed this marvelous pictorial document, and
even executed it, though probably with the assistance
of her ladies. Completed in the eleventh
century, it would seem to have been stored in
the Bayeux cathedral, where it lay, scarcely remembered,
for a period of more than six hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
years. Then attention was called to its artistic
and historic value, and it became still more widely
known when Napoleon brought it to Paris and
exhibited it at the Louvre. Now it is back in
Bayeux, and has a special room in the museum
there and a special glass case so arranged that
you can walk around it and see each of its fifty-eight
tableaux.</p>

<p class='c011' >Matilda was ahead of her time in art. She was
a futurist&mdash;anybody could see that who had been
to one of the recent exhibitions. But she was
exactly abreast in the matter of history. It is
likely that she embroidered the events as they
were reported to her, and her records are beyond
price to-day. I suppose she sat in a beautiful
room with her maids about her, all engaged at the
great work, and I hope she looked as handsome
as she looks in the fine painting that hangs above
the case containing her masterpiece.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was the closing hour when we got to the
Bayeux museum, but the guardian generously
gave us plenty of time to walk around and look
at all the marvelous procession of horses and
men, whose outlines have remained firm and
whose colors have stayed fresh for more than
eight hundred years. There is something fine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
and stirring about Matilda's tapestry. No matter
if Harold does seem to be having an attack of
pleurisy, when he is only putting on his armor,
or if the horses appear to have detachable legs.
I could see that the Joy, who is a judge of horses,
did not think much of Queen Matilda's drawing,
and their riders were not much better. Still, it
was wonderful how they did seem to "go" in
some of the battles, and they made that old story
seem very real to us. Tradition has it that the
untimely death of Matilda left the tapestry unfinished,
for which reason William's coronation
does not appear.</p>

<p class='c011' >Next day, at Caen, we visited Matilda's tomb,
in a church which she herself founded. Her remains
have never been disturbed. We also
visited the tomb of the Conqueror, on the other
side of the city at the church of St. Etienne. But
the Conqueror's bones are not there now; they
were scattered by the Huguenots in 1562.</p>

<p class='c011' >We enjoyed Caen. We wandered about
among its ancient churches and still more ancient
streets. At one church a wedding was going on,
and Narcissa and I lingered a little, to assist.
One does not get invited to a Normandy wedding
every day, especially in the old town where William
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
I organized his followers to invade England.
No doubt this bride and groom were descendants
of some of William's wild Normans, but they
looked very mild and handsome and modern,
to us.</p>

<p class='c011' >Caen became an important city under William
the Conqueror. Edward III of England captured
and pillaged it about the middle of the fourteenth
century, at which time it was larger than
any city in England, except London. To-day,
Caen has less than fifty thousand inhabitants, and
is mainly interesting for its art treasures and its
memories.</p>

<p class='c011' >Our travel program included Rouen, Amiens,
and Beauvais, cathedral cities lying more to the
northward. It was at Rouen that we started to
trace backward the sacred footsteps of Joan of
Arc, saint and savior of France. For it is at
Rouen that the pathway ends. When we had
visited the great cathedral, whose fairylike façade
is one of the most beautiful in the world, we drove
to a corner of the old market-place and stopped
before a bronze tablet which tells that on this spot
on a certain day in May, 1431 (it was the 29th),
a young girl who had saved her country from an
invading and conquering enemy was burned at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
the stake. That was five hundred years ago, but
time has not dulled the tragedy of the event, its
memory of suffering, its humiliation. All those
centuries since, the nation that Joan saved has
been trying to atone for her death. Streets have
been named for her and statues have been set up
for her in public squares all over France.</p>

<p class='c011' >There is little in Rouen to-day that Joan saw.
The cathedral was there in her time, but she was
never permitted to enter it. There is a wall
which was a part of the chapel where she had her
final hearing before her judges; there are some
houses which she must have passed, and there is
a tower which belonged to the castle in which she
was imprisoned, though it is not certain that it
is Joan's tower. There is a small museum in it,
and among its treasures we saw the manuscript
article "St. Joan of Arc," by Mark Twain, who,
in the "Personal Recollections," has left to the
world the loveliest picture of that lovely life.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was our purpose to leave Rouen by the
Amiens road, but when we got to it and looked
up a hill that, about half-way to the zenith, arrived
at the sky, we decided to take a road that led
off toward Beauvais. We could have climbed
that hill well enough, and I wished later we had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
done so. As it was, we ran along pleasantly during
the afternoon, and attended evening services
in an old church at Grandvilliers, a place that we
had never heard of before, but where we found an
inn as good as any in Normandy.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is curious with what exactness fate times its
conclusions. If we had left Grandvilliers a few
seconds earlier or later, it would have made all
the difference, or if I had not pulled up a moment
to look at a lovely bit of brookside planted with
poplars, or if I had driven the least bit slower
or the least bit faster during the first five miles;
or&mdash;</p>

<p class='c011' >Oh, never mind&mdash;what happened was this: we
had just mounted a long steep hill on high speed
and I had been bragging of the car,&mdash;always a
dangerous thing to do,&mdash;when I saw ahead of us
a big two-wheeled cart going in the same direction
as ourselves, and, beyond it, a large car approaching.
I could have speeded up and cut in
ahead of the cart, but I was feeling well, and I
thought I should do the courteous thing, the safe
thing. So I fell in behind it. Not far enough
behind, however, for as the big car came opposite,
the sleepy driver of the cart awoke, pulled up his
horse short, and we were not far enough behind
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
for me to get the brakes down hard and suddenly
enough to stop before we touched him. It was
not a smash&mdash;it was just a push. But it pushed
a big hole in our radiator, smashed up one of our
lamps, and crinkled up our left mud-guard. The
radiator was the worst. The water poured out.
Our car looked as if it had burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c011' >We were really stupefied at the extent of our
disaster.</p>

<p class='c011' >The big car at once pulled up to investigate and
console us. The occupants were Americans, too,
from Washington&mdash;kindly people who wanted to
shoulder some of the blame. Their chauffeur, a
Frenchman, bargained with the cart driver who
had wrecked us to tow us to the next town, where
there were garages. Certainly, pride goes before
a fall. Five minutes earlier we were sailing
along in glory, exulting over the prowess of our
vehicle. Now, all in the wink of an eye, our
precious conveyance, stricken and helpless, was
being towed to the hospital, its owners trudging
mournfully behind.</p>

<p class='c011' >The village was Poix; and if one had to be
wrecked anywhere, I cannot think of a lovelier
spot for disaster than Poix de la Somme. It is
just across in Picardy, and the river Somme is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
little brook that ripples and winds through poplar-shaded
pastures, sweet meadows, and deep
groves. In every direction are the loveliest
walks, with landscape pictures at every turn.
The village itself is drowsy, kindly, simple-hearted.
The landlady at our inn was a large,
motherly soul that, during the week of our stay,
the Joy learned to love, and I to be grateful to.</p>

<p class='c011' >For the others did not linger. Paris was not
far away, and had a good deal to recommend it.
The new radiator ordered from London might be
delayed. So, early next morning they were off
for Paris by way of Amiens and Beauvais, and
the Joy and I settled down to such employments
and amusements as we could find while waiting
for repairs. We got acquainted with the garage
man's family, for one thing. They lived in the
same little court with the shop, and we exchanged
Swiss French for their Picardese and were bosom
friends in no time. We spruced up the car, too,
and every day took long walks, and every afternoon
took some luncheon and our spirit-stove and
followed down the Somme to a little bridge and
there made our tea. Then, sometimes, we read;
and once, when I was reading aloud from "Joan
of Arc" and had finished the great battle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
Patay, we suddenly remembered that it had happened
on the very day on which we were reading,
the eighteenth of June.</p>

<p class='c011' >How little we guessed that in such a short time
our peaceful little river would give its name to a
battle a thousand times greater than any that
Joan ever fought!</p>

<p class='c011' >One day I hired a bicycle for the Joy, and entertained
the village by pushing her around the
public square until she learned to ride alone.
Then I hired one for myself, and we went out on
the road together.</p>

<p class='c011' >About the end of the third day we began to
look for our radiator, and visited the express-office
with considerable regularity. Presently
the village knew us, why we were there, and
what we were expecting. They became as
anxious about it as ourselves.</p>

<p class='c011' >One morning, as we started toward the express-office,
a man in a wagon passed and called
out something. We did not catch it; but
presently another met us, and, with a glad look,
told us that our goods had arrived and were now
in the delivery wagon on the way to the garage.
We did not recognize either of those good souls,
but they were interested in our welfare. Our
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
box was at the garage when we arrived there. It
was soon opened and the new radiator in place.
The other repairs had been made, and once more
we were complete. We decided to start next
morning to join the others in Paris.</p>

<p class='c011' >Morning comes early on the longest days of
the year, and we had eaten our breakfast, had our
belongings put into the car, and were ready to be
off by seven o'clock. What a delicious morning
it was! Calm, glistening, the dew on everything.
As long as I live I shall remember that golden
morning when the Joy, age eleven, and I went
gipsying together, following the winding roads
and byways that led us through pleasant woods,
under sparkling banks, and along the poplar-planted
streams of Picardy. We did not keep to
highways at all. We were in no hurry, and we
took any lane that seemed to lead in the right direction,
so that much of the time we appeared to
be crossing fields&mdash;fields of flowers, many of
them, scarlet poppies, often mingled with blue
corn-flowers and yellow mustard&mdash;fancy the
vividness of that color!</p>

<p class='c011' >Traveling in that wandering fashion, it was
noon before we got down to Beauvais, where we
stopped for luncheon supplies and to see what is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
perhaps the most remarkable cathedral in the
world. It is one of the most beautiful, and,
though it consists only of choir and transepts, it
is one of the largest. Its inner height, from floor
to vaulting, is 158 feet. The average ten-story
skyscraper could be set inside of it. There was
once a steeple that towered to the giddy height of
five hundred feet, but in 1573, when it had been
standing three hundred years, it fell down from
having insufficient support. The inner work is
of white stone,&mdash;marble,&mdash;and the whole place
seems filled with light.</p>

<p class='c011' >Beauvais has many interesting things, but the
day had become very warm, and we did not linger.
We found some of the most satisfactory pastries
I have ever seen in France, fresh, and dripping
with richness; also a few other delicacies, and by
and by, under a cool apple-tree on the road to
Compiègne, the Joy and I spread out our feast
and ate it and listened to some little French birds
singing, "<i>Vite! Vite! Vite!</i>" meaning that we
must be "Quick! Quick! Quick!" so they could
have the crumbs.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was at Compiègne that Joan of Arc was captured
by her enemies, just a year before that last
fearful day at Rouen. She had relieved Orleans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
she had fought Patay, she had crowned the king
at Rheims; she would have had her army safely
in Paris if she had not been withheld by a weak
king, influenced by his shuffling, time-serving
counselors. She had delivered Compiègne the
year before, but now again it was in trouble, besieged
by the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p class='c011' >"I will go to my good friends of Compiègne,"
she said, when the news came; and taking such
force as she could muster, in number about six
hundred cavalry, she went to their relief.</p>

<p class='c011' >From a green hill commanding the valley of
the Oise the Joy and I looked down upon the
bright river and pretty city which Joan had seen
on that long ago afternoon of her last battle for
France. Somewhere on that plain the battle had
taken place, and Joan's little force for the first
time had failed. There had been a panic; Joan,
still fighting and trying to rally her men, had been
surrounded, dragged from her horse, and made
a prisoner. She had led her last charge.</p>

<p class='c011' >We crossed a bridge and entered the city, and
stopped in the big public square facing Laroux's
beautiful statue of Joan which the later "friends
of Compiègne" have raised to her memory. It is
Joan in semi-armor, holding aloft her banner; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
on the base in old French is inscribed, "<i>Je yray
voir mes bons amys de Compiègne</i>"&mdash;"I will go to
see my good friends of Compiègne."</p>

<p class='c011' >Many things in Compiègne are beautiful, but
not many of them are very old. Joan's statue
looks toward the handsome and richly ornamented
hôtel de ville, but Joan could not have seen
this building, for it dates a hundred years after
her death. There are the handsome churches,
in one or both of which she doubtless worshiped,
when she had first delivered the city, and possibly
a few houses of that ancient time still survive.</p>

<p class='c011' >Next morning we visited the palace. It has
been much occupied by royalty, for Compiègne
was always a favorite residence of the rulers of
France. Napoleon came there with the Empress
Marie Louise, and Louis Philippe and Napoleon
III both found retirement there.</p>

<p class='c011' >I think it could not have been a very inviting
or restful home. There are long halls and picture-galleries,
all with shiny floors and stiffly
placed properties, and the royal suites are just a
series of square, fancily decorated and upholstered
boxes strung together, with doors between.
But then palaces were not meant to be cozy.
Pretty soon we went back to the car and drove
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
into a big forest for ten miles or more to an old
feudal castle,&mdash;such a magnificent old castle, all
towers and turrets and battlements,&mdash;the château
of Pierrefonds, one of the finest in France. It
stands upon a rocky height overlooking a lake,
and it does not seem so old, though it had been
there forty years when Joan of Arc came, and it
looks as if it might remain there about as long as
the hill it stands on. It was built by Louis of
Orleans, brother of Charles VI, and the storm of
battle has often raged about its base. Here and
there it still shows the mark of bombardment, and
two cannon-balls stick fast in the wall of one of
its solid towers. Pierrefonds was in bad repair,
had become well nigh a ruin, in fact, when Napoleon
III at his own expense engaged Viollet-le-Duc
to restore it, in order that France might have
a perfect type of the feudal castle in its original
form. It stands to-day as complete in its structure
and decoration as it was when Louis of
Orleans moved in, more than five hundred years
ago, and it conveys exactly the solid, home surroundings
of the mediæval lord. It is just a
show place now, and its vast court and its chapel
and halls of state are all splendid enough, though
nothing inside can be quite as magnificent as its
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
mighty assemblage of towers and turrets rising
above the trees and reflecting in the blue waters
of a placid lake.</p>

<p class='c011' >It began raining before we got to Paris, so we
did not stop at Crepy-en-Valois or Senlis, or
Chantilly, or St. Denis. In fact, neither the Joy
nor I hungered even for Paris, which we had
once visited. The others had already seen their
fill, so, with only a day's delay, we all took the
road to Versailles.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was at Rambouillet that we lodged, an
ancient place with a château and a vast park; also,
an excellent inn&mdash;the Croix Blanche&mdash;one of
those that you enter by driving through to an
inner court. Before dinner we took a walk into
the park, along the lakeside and past the château,
where Frances I died, in 1547.</p>

<p class='c011' >We were off next morning, following the rich
and lovely valley of the Eure, to Chartres. We
had already seen the towers from a long distance,
when we turned at last into the cathedral square,
and remembered the saying that "The choir of
Beauvais and the nave of Amiens, the portal of
Rheims and the towers of Chartres would together
make the finest church in the world." To
confess the truth, I did not think the towers of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
Chartres as handsome as those of Rouen, but then
I am not a purist in cathedral architecture. Certainly,
the cathedral itself is glorious. I shall not
attempt to describe it. Any number of men have
written books trying to do that, and most of them
have failed. I only know that the wonder of its
architecture, the marvel of its relief carving, "lace
in stone," and the sublime glory of its windows
somehow possessed us, and we did not know when
to go. I met a woman once who said she had
spent a month at Chartres and put in most of it
sitting in the cathedral, looking at those windows.
When she told me of it I had been inclined to
be scornful. I was not so any more. Those
windows, made by some unknown artist, dead five
hundred years, invite a lifetime of contemplation.</p>

<p class='c011' >We left Chartres by one of the old city gates,
and through a heavenly June afternoon followed
the straight, level way to Châteaudun, an ancient
town perched upon the high cliff above the valley
of the Loir, which is a different river from the
Loire&mdash;much smaller and more picturesque.</p>

<p class='c011' >The château itself hangs on the very verge of
the cliffs, with starling effect, and looks out over
a picture valley as beautiful as any in France.
This was the home of Dunois, who left it to fight
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
under Joan of Arc. He was a great soldier, one
of her most loved and trusted generals. We
spent an hour or more wandering through
Dunois's ancient seat, with an old guardian who
clearly was in love with every stone of it and who
time and again reminded us that it was more
interesting than any of the great châteaux of
the Loire, Blois especially, in that it had been
scarcely restored at all. About the latest addition
to Châteaudun was a beautiful open stairway of
the sixteenth century, in perfect condition to-day.
On the other side is another fine façade and stairway,
which Dunois himself added. In a niche
there stands a statue of the famous old soldier,
probably made from life. If only some sculptor
or painter might have preserved for us the features
of Joan!</p>

<p class='c011' >Through that golden land which lies between
the Loir and the Loire we drifted through a long
summer afternoon, and came at evening to a
noble bridge that crossed a wide, tranquil river,
beyond which rose the towers of ancient Tours,
capital of Touraine.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Touraine was a favorite place for kings,
who built their magnificent country palaces in all
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
directions. There are more than fifty châteaux
within easy driving distance of Tours.</p>

<p class='c011' >We did not, by any means, intend to visit all
of the châteaux, for château visiting from a diversion
may easily degenerate into labor. We
had planned especially, however, to see Chinon,
where Joan of Arc went to meet the king to ask
for soldiers.</p>

<p class='c011' >This is not on the Loire, but on a tributary a
little south of it, the Vienne, with the castle
crowning the long hill, or ridge, above the town.
Some time during the afternoon we came to the
outskirts of the ancient place, and looked up to
the ruined battlements and towers where occurred
that meeting which meant the liberation of
France.</p>

<p class='c011' >The château to-day is the ruin of what
originally was three châteaux, built at different
times, but closely strung together, so that in ruin
they are scarcely divided.</p>

<p class='c011' >The oldest, Coudray, was built in the tenth
century, and still shows three towers standing, in
one of which Joan of Arc lived during her stay at
Chinon. The middle château was built a hundred
years later, on the site of a Roman fort, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
it was in one of its rooms, a fragment of which
still remains, that Charles VII received the shepherd-girl
from Domremy. The Château of St.
George was built in the twelfth century, by Henry
II of England, who died there in 1189. Though
built two hundred years later than Coudray,
nothing remains of it to-day but some foundations.</p>

<p class='c011' >Chinon is a much more extensive ruin than we
had expected. Even what remains must be
nearly a quarter of a mile in length, and its vast
crumbling walls and crenelated towers make it
strikingly picturesque. But its ruin is complete,
none the less. Once through the entrance tower,
and you are under nothing but the sky, with your
feet on the grass; there is no longer a shelter
there, even for a fugitive king. You wander
about viewing it scarcely more than as a ruin, at
first, a place for painting, for seclusion, for
dreaming in the sun. Then all at once you are
facing a wall in which, half-way up, where once
was the second story, there is a restored fireplace
and a tablet which tells you that in this room
Charles VII received Joan of Arc. It is not a
room now; it is just a wall, a fragment, with vines
matting its ruined edges.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
You cross a stone foot-bridge to the tower
where Joan lived, and that also is open to the sky
and bare and desolate. While, beyond it, there
was a little chapel where she prayed, but that is
gone. There are other fragments and other
towers, but they merely serve as a setting for
those which the intimate presence of Joan made
sacred.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Maid did not go immediately to the castle
on her arrival in Chinon. She put up at an inn
down in the town and waited the king's pleasure.
His paltering advisers kept him dallying, and
postponing his consent to see her, but through the
favor of his mother-in-law, Yolande, Queen of
Sicily, Joan and her suite were presently housed
in Coudray.</p>

<p class='c011' >The king was still unready to see Joan. She
was only a stone's throw away now, but the whisperings
of his advisers kept her there. When
there were no further excuses for delay they contrived
a trick&mdash;a deception. They persuaded the
king to put another on the throne, one like him
and in his royal dress, so that Joan might pay
homage to this make-believe king, thus proving
that she had no divine power or protection which
would assist her in identifying the real one.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
In the space where now is only green grass and
sky and a broken wall, Charles VII and his court
gathered to receive the shepherd-girl who had
come to restore his kingdom. It was evening,
and the great hall was lighted, and at one end of
it was the throne with its imitation king, and, I
suppose, at the other this fireplace with its blazing
logs. Down the center of the room were the
courtiers, formed in two ranks, facing so that
Joan might pass between them to the throne.
The occasion was one of great ceremony&mdash;Joan
and her suite were welcomed with fine honors.
Banners waved, torches flared, trumpets blown at
intervals marked the stages of her progress down
the great hall; every show was made of paying
her great honor&mdash;everything that would distract
her and blind her to their trick.</p>

<p class='c011' >Charles VII, dressed as a simple courtier, stood
a little distance from the throne. Joan, advancing
to within a few steps of the pretended king,
raised her eyes. Then for a moment she stood
silent, puzzled. They expected her to kneel and
make obeisance; but a moment later she turned,
and, hurrying to the rightful Charles, dropped on
her knee and gave him heartfelt salutation. She
had never seen him, and was without knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
of his features. The protectors she had known
in her visions had not failed her. It was, perhaps,
the greatest moment in French history.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the quest for outlying châteaux, one is likely
to forget that Tours itself is very much worth
while. Tours has been a city ever since France
had a history, and it fought against Cæsar as far
far back as 52 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> It took its name from the
Gallic tribe of that section, the Turoni, dwellers
in the cliffs, I dare say, along the Loire.</p>

<p class='c011' >Tours was beloved by French royalty. It was
the capital of a province as rich as it was beautiful.
Among French provinces, Touraine was
always the aristocrat. Its language has been
kept pure. To this day, the purest French in the
world is spoken at Tours. The mechanic who
made some repairs for me at the garage leaned
on the mud-guard, during a brief intermission of
that hottest of days, and told me about the purity
of the French language at Tours; and if there
was anything wrong with his own locution, my
ear was not fine enough to detect it. To me it
seemed as limpid as something distilled. Imagine
such a thing happening in&mdash;say Bridgeport.
Tours is still proud, still the aristocrat, still royal.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Germans held Tours during the early
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
months of 1871, but there is now no trace of
their occupation. It was a bad dream which
Tours does not care even to remember.</p>

<p class='c011' >Tours contains a fine cathedral, and the remains
of what must have been a still finer one&mdash;two
noble towers, so widely separated by streets
and buildings that it is hard to imagine them ever
having belonged to one structure. They are a
part of the business of Tours now. Shops are
under them, lodgings in them. One of these old
relics is called the clock-tower, the other, the
tower of Charlemagne, because Luitgard, his
third queen, was buried beneath it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010' >It was a July morning when we got away from
Tours&mdash;one of those sweltering mornings&mdash;and
I had spent an hour or two at the garage
putting on all our repaired tires and one new one.
It was not a good morning for exercise; and by
the time we were ready to start, I was a rag.
Narcissa photographed me, because she said she
had never seen me look so interesting before.
She made me stand in the sun bareheaded and
hold a tube in my hand, as if I had not enough to
bear, already.</p>

<p class='c011' >But I was repaid the moment we were off.
Oh, but it was cool and delicious gliding along the
smooth, shaded road! One can almost afford to
get as hot and sweltering and cross and gasping
as I was for the sake of sitting back and looking
across the wheel down a leafy avenue facing the
breeze of your own making, a delicious nectar
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
that bathes you through and cools and rests and
soothes&mdash;an anodyne of peace.</p>

<p class='c011' >By and by, being really cool in mind and body,
we drew up abreast of a meadow which lay a little
below the road, a place with a brook and over-spreading
shade, and with some men and women
harvesting not far away. We thought they
would not mind if we lunched there, and I think
they must have been as kind-hearted as they were
picturesque, for they did not offer to disturb us.
It was a lovely spot, and did not seem to belong
to the present-day world at all. How could it,
with the homes of the old French kings all about,
and with these haymakers, whose fashions have
not minded the centuries, here in plain view to
make us seem a part of an ancient tale?</p>

<p class='c011' >Chenonceaux, the real heart of the royal district,
is not on the Loire itself, but on a small
tributary, the Cher. I do not remember that I
noticed the river when we entered the grounds,
but it is a very important part of the château,
which, indeed, is really a bridge over it&mdash;a supremely
beautiful bridge, to be sure, but a bridge
none the less, entirely crossing the pretty river by
means of a series of high foundation arches.
Upon these arches rises the rare edifice which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
Thomas Bohier, a receiver-general of taxes, began
back in 1515. Bohier did not extend
Chenonceaux entirely across the river. The
river to him, merely served as a moat. The son
who followed him did not have time to make
additions. Francis I came along, noticed that it
was different from the other châteaux he had confiscated,
and added it to his collection. Our
present-day collectors cut a poor figure by the side
of Francis I. Think of getting together assortments
of coins and postage-stamps and ginger-jars
when one could go out and pick up châteaux!
It was the famous Catherine de Medici, daughter-in-law
of Francis I, who finished the palace, extending
it across the Cher, making it one of the
most beautiful places in the world.</p>

<p class='c011' >We stopped a little to look at the beautiful
façade of Chenonceaux, then crossed the draw-bridge,
or what is now the substitute for it, and
were welcomed at the door by just the proper
person&mdash;a fine, dignified woman, of gentle voice
and perfect knowledge. She showed us through
the beautiful home, for it is still a home, having
been bought by Mr. Meunier, of chocolate fame
and fortune. I cannot say how glad I am that
Mr. Meunier purchased Chenonceaux. He did
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
nothing to the place to spoil it, and it is not a
museum. The lower rooms which we saw have
many of the original furnishings. The ornaments,
the tapestries, the pictures, are the same.
There is hardly another place, I think, where one
may come so nearly stepping back through the
centuries.</p>

<p class='c011' >We went out into the long wing that is built on
the arches above the river, and looked down on
the water flowing below. Our conductor told us
that the supporting arches had been built on the
foundations of an ancient mill. The beautiful
gallery which the bridge supports must have
known much gaiety; much dancing and promenading
up and down; many gallant speeches and
some heartache. The Joy wanted to see the
dungeons, but perhaps there never were any real
dungeons at Chenonceaux. Let us try to
think so.</p>

<p class='c011' >Orleans is on the Loire, and we drove to it in
the early morning from Meung, where we had
spent the night. I do not know what could be
more lovely than that leisurely hour&mdash;the distance
was fifteen miles&mdash;under cool, outspreading
branches, with glimpses of the bright river
and vistas of happy fields.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
We did not even try to imagine, as we approached
the outskirts, that the Orleans of Joan's
time presented anything of its appearance to-day.
Orleans is a modern, or modernized city, and, except
the river, there could hardly be anything in
the prospect that Joan saw. But it was the scene
of her first military conquest, and added its name
to the title by which she belongs to history. That
is enough to make it one of the holy places of
France.</p>

<p class='c011' >It has been always a military city, a place of
battles. Cæsar burned it, Attila attacked it, Clovis
captured it&mdash;there was often war of one sort
or another going on there. The English and
Burgundians would have had it in 1429 but for
the arrival of Joan's army.</p>

<p class='c011' >Joan was misled by her generals, whose faith
in her was not complete. Orleans lies on the
north bank of the Loire; they brought her down
on the south bank, fearing the prowess of the
enemy's forces. Discovering the deception, the
Maid promptly sent the main body of her troops
back some thirty-five miles to a safe crossing, and,
taking a thousand men, passed over the Loire and
entered the city by a gate which was still held by
the French. That the city was not completely
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
surrounded made it possible to attack the enemy
from within and without, while her presence
among the Orleanese would inspire them with
new hope and valor. Mark Twain, in his "Recollections,"
pictures the great moment of her entry.</p>

<p class='c013' >It was eight in the evening when she and the troops
rode in at the Burgundy gate.... She was riding a white
horse, and she carried in her hand the sacred sword of
Fierbois. You should have seen Orleans then. What a
picture it was! Such black seas of people, such a starry
firmament of torches, such roaring whirlwinds of welcome,
such booming of bells and thundering of cannon!
It was as if the world was come to an end. Everywhere
in the glare of the torches one saw rank upon rank of upturned,
white faces, the mouths wide open, shouting, and
the unchecked tears running down; Joan forged her slow
way through the solid masses, her mailed form projecting
above the pavement of heads like a silver statue. The
people about her struggled along, gazing up at her through
their tears with the rapt look of men and women who
believed they are seeing one who is divine; and always
her feet were being kissed by grateful folk, and such as
failed of that privilege touched her horse and then kissed
their fingers.</p>

<p class='c011' >This was the twenty-ninth of April. Nine
days later, May 8, 1429, after some fierce fighting,
during which Joan was severely wounded, the
besiegers were scattered. Orleans was free.
Mark Twain writes:</p>

<p class='c013' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
No other girl in all history has ever reached such a
summit of glory as Joan of Arc reached that day....
Orleans will never forget the eighth of May, nor ever fail
to celebrate it. It is Joan of Arc's day&mdash;and holy.</p>

<p class='c011' >Two days, May seventh and eighth, are given
each year to the celebration, and Orleans in other
ways has honored the memory of her deliverer.
A wide street bears her name, and there are noble
statues, and a museum, and church offerings.
The Boucher home, which sheltered Joan during
her sojourn in Orleans, has been preserved&mdash;at
least, a house is still shown as the Boucher house,
though how much of the original structure remains
no one of this day seems willing to decide.</p>

<p class='c011' >We drove there first, for it is the only spot in
Orleans that can claim even a possibility of having
known Joan's actual presence. It is a house
of the old half-timbered architecture, and if these
are not the veritable walls that Joan saw, they
must, at least, bear a close resemblance to those of
the house of Jacques Boucher, treasurer of the
Duke of Orleans, where Joan was made welcome.
A few doors away is a fine old mansion, now a
museum, and fairly overflowing with objects of
every conceivable sort relating to Joan of Arc.
Books, statuary, paintings, armor, banners, offerings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
coins, medals, ornaments, engravings, letters&mdash;thousands
upon thousands of articles
gathered here in the Maid's memory. I think
there is not one of them that her hand ever
touched, or that she ever saw, but in their entirety
they convey, as nothing else could, the reverence
that Joan's memory inspired during the centuries
that have gone since her presence made this
ground sacred. Until the revolution, Orleans
preserved Joan's banner, some of her clothing,
and other genuine relics; but then the mob burned
them, probably because Joan delivered France to
royalty. We were shown an ancient copy of the
banner, still borne, I believe, in the annual festivities.
Baedeker speaks of arms and armor worn
at the siege of Orleans, but the guardian of the
place was not willing to guarantee their genuineness.
I think Narcissa, who worships the memory
of Joan, was almost sorry that he thought it
necessary to be so honest. He did show us a
photograph of Joan's signature. She wrote it
"Jehanne," and her pen must have been guided
by her secretary, for Joan could neither read nor
write.</p>

<p class='c011' >We drove to the Place Martroi to see the large
equestrian statue of Joan by Foyatier, with reliefs
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
by Vital Dubray. It is very imposing, and the reliefs,
showing the great moments in Joan's career,
are really fine. We did not care to hunt for other
memorials. It was enough to drive about the
city, trying to pick out a house here and there that
looked as if it might have been standing five hundred
years, but if there were any of that age&mdash;any
that had looked upon the wild joy of Joan's entrance
and upon her triumphal departure, they
were very few indeed.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c011' >It is a grand, straight road from Orleans to
Fontainebleau, and it passes through Pithiviers,
which did not look especially interesting, though
we discovered, when it was too late, that it is
noted for its almond-cakes and lark-pies. I
wanted to go back, then, but the majority decided
against me, and in the late afternoon we entered
the majestic royal forest, and by and by came to
the palace and the little town and to a pretty hotel
on a side street, that was really a village inn for
comfort and welcome. There was still plenty of
daylight, mellow, waning daylight, and the palace
was not far away. We would not wait for it
until morning.</p>

<p class='c011' >I think we most enjoyed seeing palaces about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
the closing-hour. There are seldom any other
visitors then, and the fading afternoon sunlight
in the vacant rooms softens their garish emptiness
and seems, somehow, to bring nearer the rich
pageant of life and love and death that flowed
through them so long, and then one day came to
an end, and now it is not passing any more. It
was really closing-time when we arrived at the
palace, but the custodian was lenient, and for an
hour we wandered through gorgeous galleries,
and salons, and suites of private apartments,
where kings and queens lived gladly, loved madly,
died sadly for about three hundred years.
Francis I built Fontainebleau, on the site of a
mediæval castle. He was a hunter, and the
forests of Fontainebleau were always famous
hunting-grounds. Louis XIII, who was born in
Fontainebleau, built the grand entrance staircase,
from which, a hundred years later, Napoleon
Bonaparte bade good-by to his generals before
starting for Elba. Other kings have added to the
place and embellished it; the last being Napoleon
III, who built for Eugénie the bijou theater across
the court.</p>

<p class='c011' >It may have been our mood, it may have been
the tranquil evening light, it may have been reality
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
that Fontainebleau was more friendly, more alive,
more a place for living men and women to inhabit
than any other palace we have seen. It was hard
to imagine Versailles as having ever been a home
for anybody. At Fontainebleau I felt that we
were intruding&mdash;that Marie Antoinette, Marie
Louise, or Eugénie might enter at any moment
and find us there.</p>

<p class='c011' >The apartments of the first Napoleon and
Marie Louise tell something, too, but the story
seems less intimate. Yet the table is there on
which Napoleon signed his abdication, while an
escort waited to take him to Elba, and in his study
is his writing-table; and there is a bust by
Canova; but that is marble, and does not encourage
the thought of life.</p>

<p class='c011' >For size and magnificence the library is the
most impressive room in Fontainebleau. It is
very lofty, very splendid, and it is two hundred
and sixty-four feet long. Napoleon III gave
great hunting-banquets there. Since then it has
always been empty, except for visitors.</p>

<p class='c011' >The light was getting dim by the time we
reached the pretty theater which Louis Napoleon
built for Eugénie. It is a very choice place, and
we were allowed to go on the stage and behind
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
the scenes and up in the galleries, and there was
something in the dusky vacancy of that little play-house,
built to amuse the last empress of France,
that affected us almost more than any of the rest
of the palace, though it was built not so long ago
and its owner is still alive. It is not used, the
custodian told us&mdash;has never been used since
Eugénie went away. I believe nothing at Fontainebleau
gave more delight to Narcissa and the
Joy than this dainty theater.</p>

<p class='c011' >From a terrace back of the palace we looked out
on a pretty lake where Eugénie's son used to sail
a miniature, full-rigged ship, large enough, if one
could judge from a picture we saw, to have held
the little prince himself. There was still sunlight
on the tree-tops, and these and the prince's pretty
pavilion reflecting in the placid water made the
place beautiful. But the little vessel was not
there. I wished, as we watched, that it might
come sailing by. I wished that the prince had
never been exiled, and that he had not grown up
and gone to his death in a South African jungle.
I wished that he might be back to sail his ship
again, and that Eugénie might be young and have
her theater once more, and that Louis Napoleon's
hunting-parties might still gather in the painted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
ball-room and fill the vacant palace with something
besides mere curiosity and vain imaginings.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c011' >We had meant to go to Barbizon, home of the
artist Millet, but we got lost in the forest next
morning, and when we found ourselves, we were
a good way in the direction of Melun and concluded
to keep on, consoling ourselves with the
thought that Barbizon is not Barbizon any more,
and would probably be a disappointment, anyway.
We kept on from Melun, also, after buying some
luncheon things, and all day traversed that beautiful
rolling district which lies east of Paris
and below Rheims, arriving toward evening at
Epernay, center of the champagne district. We
had no need to linger there. We were anxious
to get to Rheims.</p>

<p class='c011' >We were still in the hills when we looked on
the valley of the Vesle and saw a city outspread
there, and in its center, mellowed and glorified by
seven kindly centuries, the architectural and
ecclesiastical pride of the world, the Cathedral of
Rheims. Large as the city was, that great central
ornament dwarfed and dominated its surroundings.
Thus Joan of Arc had seen it when,
at the head of her victorious army, she conducted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
the king to Rheims for his coronation. She approached
the fulfilment of her mission, the completion
of the great labor laid upon her by the
voices of her saints. Mark Twain tells of Joan's
approach to Rheims, of the tide of cheers that
swept her ranks at the vision of the distant
towers.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was the sixteenth of July that Joan looked
down upon Rheims, and now four hundred and
eighty-five years later it was again July, with the
same summer glory on the wood, the same green
and scarlet in the poppied fields, the same fair
valley, the same stately towers rising to the sky.
But no one can ever feel what Joan felt, can ever
put into words, ever so faintly, what that moment
and that vision meant to the Domremy shepherd-girl.</p>

<p class='c011' >Descending the plain, we entered the city,
crossed a bridge, and made our way to the cathedral
square. Then presently we were at the
doorway where Joan and her king had entered&mdash;the
portal which has been called the most beautiful
this side of paradise. How little we dreamed
that destruction and disfigurement lay only a few
weeks ahead!</p>

<p class='c011' >It is not required any more that one should
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
write descriptively of the now vanished glories of
the church of Rheims, it has been done so
thoroughly and so numerously by those so highly
qualified for the undertaking. Fergusson, who
must have been an authority, for the guide-book
quotes him, calls it, "perhaps the most beautiful
structure produced in the Middle Ages."</p>

<p class='c011' >The cathedral was already two hundred years
old when Joan arrived in 1429. But it must have
looked quite fresh and new, then, for nearly five
centuries later it seemed to have suffered little.
Some of the five hundred and thirty statues of its
wonderful portal were weatherworn and scarred,
to be sure, but the general effect of beauty and
completeness was not disturbed.</p>

<p class='c011' >Many kings had preceded Joan and her sovereign
through the sacred entrance. Long before
the cathedral was built, French sovereigns
had come to Rheims for their coronation. Here
Clovis had been baptized nearly a thousand years
before.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was a mighty assemblage that gathered for
the crowning of Joan's king. France, overrun
by an invader, had known no real king for years&mdash;had,
indeed, well nigh surrendered her nationality.
Now victory, in the person of a young
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
girl from an obscure village, had crowned their
arms and brought redemption to their throne.
No wonder the vast church was packed, and that
crowds were massed outside. From all directions
had come pilgrims to the great event&mdash;persons
of every rank, among them two shepherds,
Joan's aged father and uncle, who had walked
from Domremy, one hundred and twenty miles, to
verify with their own eyes what their ears could
not credit.</p>

<p class='c011' >We are told that the abbot, attended by the
archbishop, his canons, and a deputation of nobles,
entered the crowded church, followed by the five
mounted knights who rode down the great central
aisle, clear to the choir, and then at a signal
backed their prancing steeds all the distance to
the great doors.</p>

<p class='c011' >Very likely the cathedral at Rheims had never
known such a throng until that day, nor heard
such a mighty shout as went up when Joan and
the king, side by side and followed by a splendid
train, appeared at the great side entrance and
moved slowly to the altar.</p>

<p class='c011' >I think there must have fallen a deep hush then&mdash;a
petrified stillness that lasted through the long
ceremonial, while every eye feasted itself upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
the young girl standing there at the king's side,
holding her victorious standard above him&mdash;the
banner that "had borne the burden and had
earned the victory," as she would one day testify
at her trial. I am sure that vast throng would
keep silence, scarcely breathing, until the final
word was spoken and the dauphin had accepted
the crown and placed it upon his head. But then
we may hear, borne faintly down the centuries,
the roar of renewed shouting that told to those
waiting without that the great ceremony was
ended, that Charles VII of France had been annointed
king. As in a picture we seemed to see
the shepherd-girl on her knees saying to the
crowned king: "My work which was given me
to do is finished: give me your peace, and let me
go back to my mother, who is poor and old, and
has need of me."</p>

<p class='c011' >But the king raises her up and praises her and
confers upon her nobility and titles, and asks her
to name a reward for her service, and we hear
her ask that Domremy, "poor and hard-pressed
by reason of the war," may have its taxes remitted.</p>

<p class='c011' >Nothing for herself&mdash;no more than that; and
in the presence of all the great assemblage Charles
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
VII decreed that by grace of Joan of Arc,
Domremy should be free from taxes forever.</p>

<p class='c011' >There within those walls it was all reality five
hundred years ago. One did not study the interior
to discover special art values or to distinguish
in what manner it differed from others
we had seen. For us the light from its great
rose-window and upper arches was glorified because
once it fell upon Joan of Arc in that
supreme moment when she saw her labor finished
and asked only that she might return to Domremy
and her flocks. The statues in the niches were
sacred because they looked upon that scene, the
altar paving was sanctified because it felt the
pressure of her feet.</p>

<p class='c011' >Back of the altar stood a statue of Joan unlike
any we had seen elsewhere, and to us more beautiful.
It was not Joan with her banner aloft, her
eyes upward. It was Joan with her eyes lowered,
looking at no outward thing, her face passive&mdash;the
saddest face and the saddest eyes in the world&mdash;Joan
the sacrifice of her people and her king.</p>

<p class='c011' >It may have been two miles out of Rheims that
we met the flood. There had been one heavy
shower as we entered the city, but presently the
sun broke out, bright and hot, too bright and too
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
hot for permanence. Now suddenly all was black
again, there was a roar of thunder, and then such
an opening of the water-gates of the sky as would
have disturbed Noah. I turned the car over to
the side of the road, but the tall, high-trimmed
trees afforded no protection. Our top was a
shelter, but not a complete one&mdash;the wind drove
the water in, and in a moment our umbrellas were
sticking out in every direction and we had huddled
together like chickens. The world was
blotted out. I had the feeling at moments that
we were being swept down some great submarine
current.</p>

<p class='c011' >I don't know how long the inundation lasted.
It may have been five minutes or thirty. Then
suddenly it stopped&mdash;it was over&mdash;the sun was
out.</p>

<p class='c011' >There was then no mud in France,&mdash;not in the
highroads,&mdash;and a moment or two later we had
revived, our engine was going, and we were gliding
between fair fields&mdash;fresh, shining fields
where scarlet poppy-patches were as pools of
blood. How peaceful it all was then, for there is
no lovelier land than the Marne district from
Rheims to Châlons and to Vitry-le-Francois.
Yet it has been often a war district&mdash;a battle-ground;
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
it has been fought over time and again
since the ancient allies defeated Attila and his
Huns there, checking the purpose of the "Scourge
of God," as he called himself. It could never be
a battle-ground again, we thought&mdash;the great nations
were too advanced for war. Ah me! within
two months from that day men were lying dead
across that very road, shells were tearing at the
lovely fields, and another stain had mingled with
the trampled poppies.</p>

<p class='c011' >Châlons-sur-Marne, like Rheims and Epernay,
is a champagne center and seemed prosperous.
There are some churches there, but they did not
seem of great importance.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was in July when we were on the Marne. In
an earlier chapter I have told how, only three
weeks later, when we had reached Vevey, Switzerland,
the "great upheaval" came, and with
what disturbing consequences. We did not leave
Europe with the early rush. For a time we hesitated
about leaving at all. But then uncertainties
increased. With Italy planning war, the possibility
of not being able to leave when we were
ready was not comforting. So in October at last
we got a military pass to take the car out of
Switzerland, and on one of the last days of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
month set off up the Rhone Valley, down which
Cæsar's armies once had marched, and drove to
Brigue, and the next day crossed the Simplon
Pass&mdash;up and up more than six thousand feet,
where the snow was flying, and where there are
no villages any more, but only a hospice, and here
and there a wayside shelter. Then through a
wild, savage-looking land&mdash;down and down, into
Italy, arriving in the rain at Domodossola, glad,
oh so glad, for safe shelter and food and beds!</p>

<p class='c011' >I will not tell here of our month's wanderings
in Italy. But one day our reliable car was loaded
on a vessel for home, and a little later we were
aboard the same ship, breasting such storms as
made it seem impossible that only a little while
before we had been in a sunny land, gliding
smoothly over a solid surface that did not heave,
and toss, and roar, day and night, without end;
then by and by a day came when we were gliding
once more over smooth, solid ground&mdash;this time in
our own land, far from the quaint villages, the
bright rivers, the ancient castles, the sunny slopes,
and perfect roads of France.</p>

<p class='c011' >Yet America is not without its glories. And
though it has fewer quaint villages and no
ancient castles, it has at least as fair scenery, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
fertile lands, and its roads are growing better and
more numerous every day. Our wayside inns
will improve, too, I am sure of it, until America,
like France, may become another paradise. Narcissa
and the Joy were patriotic enough to be gladdened
at the sight of New England shores and
hillsides, and, as Narcissa says:</p>

<p class='c011' >"Well, if we didn't see America first, we'll
probably have plenty of time to see it now."</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>LETTER-BOXES IN FOREIGN LANDS</span><br /> <br />BY A. R. ROY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >The first letter-box ever used was established
in Paris in 1560. It is true that a
kind of letter-box was in use in Italy before that
time; it was not used, however, by the postal service,
but as a place for denunciations directed to
the police.</p>

<p class='c011' >The first letter-box in Germany was established
in 1766, in Berlin. At first the boxes were simple;
both for depositing letters and for removing
them the cover was lifted. During the last century
a great many different styles of boxes have
been introduced, but the so-called Swedish system
is now in universal use.</p>

<p class='c011' >In Germany the letter-boxes are highly ornamental,
and in many cases made especially to be
in harmony with the architecture of the building
to which they are fastened. They are painted
blue, and show the coat of arms of the empire and
that of the postal department, a post-horn with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
tassels. The mail is removed by fastening a bag
to the bottom of the box; the bag is slipped in and
opens and closes automatically. The postman
does not handle or even see the letters, and cannot
get at them.</p>

<p class='c011' >In London large letter-boxes are placed on the
sidewalk, at nearly every street corner. They
have different compartments for city and country
mail, and this, as well as the height of the apertures,
makes them rather inconvenient for any but
grown people. While they are painted a brilliant
red and therefore very conspicuous, they are by
no means an embellishment to the city. The letters
are taken out by opening a large door and
literally shoveling the mail-matter into a bag.</p>

<p class='c011' >The letter-box in the general post-office in England
is a magnificent construction. The sign-board
is made of brass, on which the directions
are engraved in ink. Large slits provide for the
country and colonial mails, and there is also a
different compartment for newspapers and parcels.</p>

<p class='c011' >The modern French letter-box has the shape
of a pillar, profusely ornamented with the conventional
lily. The whole box or stand is fashioned
after a plant, and the top resembles a bud.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
The body is surrounded by floral wreaths or festoons,
and the base is formed by large leaves.
The boxes are placed against buildings and have
a very pretty effect.</p>

<p class='c011' >In Brussels the government keeps pace with
the needs of the people, and has attached postal
boxes to the rear ends of cars in the city. This
aids and hastens the delivery of letters and telegrams,
as most of these cars pass the post-offices,
where the boxes are emptied. This street-car
letter-box, in fact, virtually takes the place of the
"pneumatic tube" postal system, for which London
and Berlin have become famous.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Russian post-box is an old-fashioned, awkward-looking
box. It looks something like a
peasant hut. The roof is lifted up, and the letters
are taken out from the top. The postman
handles the letters as freely as the sorters themselves.
In times past the governmental power in
Russia was so strict that it is believed the post-office
officials frequently opened letters suspected
of being connected with plots against the State,
and read them.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Italian post-boxes are prettily constructed
and grouped together in threes and fours. One
box is used for the city, another for the country,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
and by the side is a big automatic machine for
stamps. A "penny in the slot" supplies the various
kinds of stamps required.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Amsterdam letter-pillar is of very artistic
construction, which is both pleasing to the eye
and practical. The royal arms are conspicuously
and prettily embossed on the face of the box, and
below them are two rosettes of conventional style.
There are two letter-slits, one for the country
and one for the city. The top is crowned with
ornamental bowers. Right above the pillar is a
board on which the times of delivery and collection
are clearly written.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Rumanian letter-boxes are all numbered
in large letters so as to help the public to keep
track of where they post their mail, and also the
postman in his collection. It is a simple square
box which is placed generally on the walls of
large buildings in the main streets.</p>

<p class='c011' >Throughout the Orient, where the national influences
are many and various, each country has
its own post-office. For instance, the British
have their own, and the French and the Germans
theirs. The stamps used by each of these post-offices
are, of course, their own, there not being
a universal system for all countries.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
Right on the city gate in Tangier we find, in
this town of an old civilization, the convenience
of most modern time&mdash;a letter-box. Before the
natives were used to them they were considered
as wonderful machines into which a missive once
being put was mysteriously conveyed to its destination,
and they were generally feared. To-day
the smallest boy uses them. The style of course
varies with the power that puts it up.</p>

<p class='c011' >Here we can notice with what expression of
wonderment the native posts a letter. He is only
certain the letter will go, but how, he does not
know.</p>

<p class='c011' >The German post-box is painted blue, and has
only German directions written on it. The directions
giving time of delivery and collection are
written in many languages.</p>

<p class='c011' >The final photograph shows a letter-box on a
Moorish gateway in Tangier, Morocco. And
here this convenience of modern days looks
strange in its surroundings of Arabic fresco and
characters. No attempt has been made to harmonize
with the Moorish architecture. The letters
are collected from an opening on the other
side of the wall.</p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>LOST RHEIMS</span><br /> <br />BY LOUISE EUGÉNIE PRICKITT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >"Rheims, which has been on fire for a week,
is now nothing but a great pile of smoking
ruins," I read in the paper of the man who sat
next to me in the subway. With a sick heart I
read on: "There are no traces of streets and
thoroughfares, which have disappeared from
view under the accumulation of debris. Ancient
buildings in the Place Royal and the market-place
and the Musicians' House, which dates from the
sixteenth century, have been reduced to dust and
ashes." With a doubly sad heart I read it, for to
me it is more than an old French city that lies in
ruins, since with it goes the picturesque and historic
background of my early youth. It is the
tragic passing of my city of dreams, for there I
dreamed away eight happy years of girlhood.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is an enviable thing to live in an ancient city
like Rheims till its history becomes a part of the
texture of one's mind, till the background of that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
history, hangs like a series of distinct pictures in
one's thought, not to be effaced by anything that
shall come afterward. The streets of Rheims as
they then stood are photographed clearly on the
retina of my mind's eye, and, dominating all, as
it did at my first sight of it, is the majestic shape
of the cathedral. I enter again, in imagination,
those beautiful portals, and feel myself a tiny
figure, and young in the midst of hoary antiquity.
The organ music surges through the building, the
choir-boys' voices soar above it. I see again the
slanting fall of colored light across the wide gray
floors, the soft blue smoke of the rising incense,
the towering pillars, the vaulted roof, the dim
vistas ending in the splendor of painted windows.
Years and years of patient labor it took to rear
this marvel. It represented the ideality of an
age; it was, in fact, that ideality incarnate, left
standing for all posterity to see and take inspiration
from.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was at sunset one December day that I first
entered Rheims. It was to be my home for the
next eight years, for my father had been appointed
by the American Government to be consul
there. How eagerly, I remember, we looked
out of the train window as we approached the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
city. Long before the town itself became distinct
to our eyes, we could plainly see the cathedral, a
superb silhouette, imposing and not to be forgotten.
It was like one's first view of the ocean or
the mountains or the desert.</p>

<p class='c011' >That night we slept opposite the cathedral in
the eighteenth-century Hôtel Lion d'Or. I recollect
the thrill of excitement my sister and I felt
as the big bus rattled into the courtyard of that
quaint hostelry and agile valets in yellow-and-black
striped waistcoats ran to open the door for
us. We felt that we were at last to live a storybook
life of adventure and romance.</p>

<p class='c011' >The deep-toned bells of the cathedral awakened
us at dawn, and in the pale light we rushed
to the windows to look out on the sculptured
façade of the wonderful building in order that
we might feel again the strange charm that had
so wrought upon us at our first sight of it. In
the open square before us a valiant figure caught
our attention, a figure of bronze that sat upon a
spirited charger and held aloft a spear&mdash;Jeanne
d'Arc, before the cathedral that had witnessed
her brief hour of glory. The story we knew well,
but shape and color it had never had before. The
centuries before ours had been hardly more to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
us than Arabian Nights' tales, yet here was the
visible evidence of the mighty procession of
people who had existed before our day. We
could not take the shortest walk in the city without
being reminded of the dim perspective of history
stretching far back of our youth, for here it
was written in tangible and enduring stone.</p>

<p class='c011' >At the rear of the Hôtel Lion d'Or we could
see the old hotel of the sign of the Maison Rouge,
where the father and mother of Jeanne d'Arc
were housed at the time of the crowning of the
dauphin. We could walk over the cobblestone
of the narrow rue de Tambour, which was once,
so history says, one of the largest and most frequented
of the streets of Rheims. We could look
up at the Maison des Musiciens, so old a building
that no one knows for what it was originally built.
On its quaint façade how often we curiously examined
the broken figures of the sculptured
musicians, for this was the street down which the
royal processions passed on their way to the coronation
at the cathedral. The soldiers in the vanguard
had struck and broken the statues with
their spears to make way for the banners and
pennants of the brilliant cavalcade. How full of
color and splendor the street must have appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
then! But that was all past, and the musicians,
in our time, looked down only upon market-women
trundling their wares through to the
market-place beyond. The old building, nevertheless,
still served to re-create, in the fancy of
two wondering girls, those stately yesterdays.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the rue Carnot how often we paused to
glance up at a curious archway supporting two
round towers! Old, very old it looked. And no
wonder! for it dated from the Middle Ages. Under
the arch we could catch a glimpse of the walls
of the cathedral, gray as frost, and the prison,
with beggars sitting in its grim shadow.</p>

<p class='c011' >How the past centuries peered out at us from
every corner, showing in quaint portals such as
the one on the school of the Petit Lycée, with its
bas-reliefs of a laughing child on one side and a
crying one on the other, known to the "<i>bons enfants</i>"
since the beginning of the school as "<i>Jean
qui rit</i>" and "<i>Jean qui pleure</i>." Or that of the
old house of the La Salle family, in the rue de
l'Arbalète, with its life-size figures of Adam and
Eve to guard the entrance.</p>

<p class='c011' >When we walked down the rue Cérès we passed
the house where Louis XIV's famous minister,
Colbert, was born, and often pictured him coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
out of the wide doorway, the courtly, velvet-clad
figure that the portrait of him in the art museum
had made familiar to our minds: for many a trip
we made to the Hôtel des Ville to see the paintings
and the wonderful illuminated books in the
library and the beautiful old building itself. We
would often stop, I remember, to read the list of
marriages posted in the vestibule, the Maries, the
Yvonnes, and the Marguerites, the Jeans, the
Marcels, and Pierres who were to "live happily
ever afterward," or so we confidently believed.
Several years later the elder sister came with her
lover to read shyly her own, for the old and dignified
Salle des Marriages was to be the background
of her romance, too.</p>

<p class='c011' >We had read Dumas, and Anne of Austria, as
every one knows, figures largely in his tales. But
that she was more real than d'Artagnan we had
hardly conceived, until one day we stood before
the seventeenth century house in the rue de
l'Université which once had the honor of sheltering
her. It belonged to Jean Mailefer, and he has
left an account of the visit in quaintly spelled old
French which we were fortunate enough to have
a chance to read. He was very proud of the
magnificence of his dwelling, and spread its luxury
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
before us as a peacock might spread his gorgeous
tail for humbler birds to admire. It was
fit for a queen he felt, and lo! she was coming.
He describes exultantly the sound of the
trumpets that signalized the consequential arrival
of royalty. "<i>Tatera, tatera, tatera! Que
d'honeurs qui vont tomber sur mes foibles espaulles!</i>"
["What honors to fall upon my poor
shoulders!"] The pride of the seventeenth century&mdash;how
laughably like it is to that of the
twentieth. The queen as she entered, jestingly
said, "The house is my own!" "Yes, <i>grande
Princess</i>, you are right," responded its owner,
quickly. At the same time the Marshal Duplessis
asked of him, "Monsieur, are you the master of
this house?" "Monsieur," replied the gallant
gentleman of Rheims, bowing with a grand air,
I make no doubt, "Monsieur, I was but a moment
ago; but when the sun appears, the stars are
eclipsed."</p>

<p class='c011' >In the rue de la Grue we searched out the house
where was born Tronson du Coudray, an eloquent
lawyer of the Paris Parliament and the courageous
defender of Marie Antoinette. With all our
young enthusiasm we loved him as the champion
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
of the ill-fated queen. The Porte de Paris, the
great iron gateway in Rheims, the guidebooks
told us was a triumph of the smith's art, but it
held our imaginations in thrall because it had been
built in honor of the crowning of Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette. Somewhere we had found an
account of the coronation, and read how joyously
they had entered the city, and how in the cathedral,
in the midst of the acclamations and applause,
so loud and prolonged that they covered
the sound of the bells and the noise of the cannon,
the "<i>gracieuse Marie Antoinette</i>" had fainted and
thus "<i>elle a perdu quelques instants du plus beau
jour de sa vie</i>" ["she had lost some moments of
the most beautiful day of her life"]. We loved
to imagine her against the background of that
rich interior of the cathedral, the light through its
glowing windows touching with iridescence the
tall gray pillars; the royal pennants and draperies,
bright tones against the sombre hues of the
marvelous tapestries; gold flashing here and there
from tall candlesticks and brilliant uniforms;
wonderful gems catching fire from the great
arched windows that seemed, in the brightness of
the sun, to be themselves made of rival jewels.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
A splendid setting for "the most beautiful day of
her life." "The height, the space, the gloom, the
glory," how they typified that life!</p>

<p class='c011' >The Porte de Paris, too, was eloquent of the
fierce days of the Revolution. The people of
Rheims tell how the mob one day came surging
toward it, when the ringleaders proposed that
they destroy the gilded crown upon its apex as
the symbol of hated royalty. Then the mayor,
a man of tactful resource, called to the most
furious of the band and asked if he had a ten-sou
piece at his service. The man readily passed it
to him, whereupon the mayor at once gave it to
a beggar standing near. "Take it," said he;
"Monsieur will have nothing with a crown upon
it." Every one laughed, and the crown on the
gate was saved.</p>

<p class='c011' >Under the wide arch of the Porte de Paris victorious
Napoleon entered after the Prussian occupation
of the city in 1814. It was already
nightfall when the fierce battle was fought, and
not until eleven o'clock was Napoleon able to
enter the city. What an ovation he received
from the rejoicing citizens&mdash;the Remois! It
thrilled us to read it. All at once the great bells
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
of the cathedral thundered forth a welcome,
while at the same time every window in the town
was lighted and a great cry of "<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>"
rang from end to end of the city. The
house in the rue de Vesle, where he slept that
night, is an old acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c011' >If the Porte de Paris seemed old to us and eloquent
of the past, what was to be said of the gray
old arch known as the Porte de Mars, that dated
before Christ and "spoke aloud for future times
to hear" of the triumphs of great Cæsar and of
the Gallo-Roman days? and what of the market-place
which was once, we were told, the Roman
forum? Even in our time, though all traces of
the forum were gone, the market-place was an
ancient-looking square, edged as it was with
quaint old buildings, among them, notably, an
elaborately carved wooden house, one of the most
curious specimens of fifteenth century art.</p>

<p class='c011' >Near by was the old church of St. Jacques.
Often we used to steal in to rest awhile in its rainbow-colored
twilight. Not as imposing as the
cathedral, but very lovely nevertheless, it was one
of the relics of the twelfth century. The cathedral,
St. Jacques, and the old abbey church of St.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
Remi&mdash;they have formed for us the beautiful and
impressive backgrounds of many a wedding and
funeral and quaint religious service.</p>

<p class='c011' >Many a time we have threaded the queer old
streets of Rheims with their queer old names&mdash;the
rue de la Clef [Street of the Key], the
rue des Deux Anges [Street of the Two
Angels], the rue des Trois Raisinets [Street
of the Three Little Grapes]. <i>The Maison des
Quatres Chats Gringnants</i> [House of the Four
Grinning Cats], the <i>Auberge du Lapin Gras</i>
[Tavern of the Fat Rabbit], curious old buildings
of the Middle Ages&mdash;we passed them by in our
youth, but we shall carry the memory of them
into our old age. How tranquil the city used to
seem to us then! Too quiet, sometimes; a
drowsy old town, we said, sitting like venerable
age sleeping in the sun. How little we dreamed
what a cruel awakening was in store for it; that
horror and terror were to stalk through all those
peaceful streets and leave their dreadful scars
behind!</p>

</div>

<p class='c010' >At Rowsley, England, the quaint old Peacock
Inn, with its vine-covered walls, casement
windows, and rare old gardens, is the picture of
peace and comfort, and it is also a perfect type of
the hostelries of bygone days.</p>

<p class='c011' >If the guest can tear himself away from its ease
and plenty, its stately gardens, and its soothing
atmosphere, the surrounding country affords
many delightful walks and attractions both historical
and romantic.</p>

<p class='c011' >Following the pretty little river Wye, one soon
comes to Haddon Hall, one of the best specimens
of medieval domestic architecture now in existence,
although it has been added to at various
periods from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p class='c011' >It was given by William the Conqueror to one
of his sons, William Peveril (Scott's "Peveril of
the Peak"), and is now the property of the Duke
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
of Rutland, a descendant of the beautiful Dorothy
Vernon, whose romantic elopement with John
Manners has been celebrated in drama, song, and
story, and lends an especial interest to the old
castle.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Vernons lived at Haddon Hall from 1195
to 1567, and, among the many beautiful women
of their line, the most beautiful is said to have
been the self-willed Dorothy. Her youthful
love-dream was thwarted by her equally obstinate
father, some say because of family feuds, others
say on account of difference in religion.</p>

<p class='c011' >Whatever the cause, parental opposition was so
strong that one night, when a grand ball was in
progress in the famous ball-room of Haddon
Hall, the heiress stole away through the door of
the anteroom and fled, in all her festive array,
along "Dorothy's Walk" (a long terrace lined
with stately yews), down the long flight of steps
to the lower terrace, and over the little bridge to
her waiting lover. He carried her away on his
fleet steed to a hasty morning wedding, carefully
placing many miles between the irate father and
the lovely bride.</p>

<p class='c011' >Dorothy's father, Sir George Vernon, "The
King of the Peak," allowed his wrath to cool in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
time, and the happy couple returned and made
their home at the Hall.</p>

<p class='c011' >John Manners was a younger son of the Earl
of Rutland, and father of the first Duke of Rutland,
whose cradle is now exhibited in the state
bedroom of Haddon Hall.</p>

<p class='c011' >The great ball-room from which Miss Dorothy
fled is over one hundred feet long, eighteen feet
wide, and fifteen feet high. On the south side,
toward the garden, are three very large, recessed
windows, and on the north side is a huge fireplace
with ancient fire-dogs. At the east end of the
room is a glass case containing a bust of Grace,
Lady Manners, wife of Sir George Manners.
This is said to have been made from a cast taken
after death. Certainly the lady was far from
beautiful if one judges from this representation
of her charms!</p>

<p class='c011' >The interior of the family chapel is in a semi-ruined
state. On the right there is a stoup for
holy water, about four hundred years old, and
just beyond it are the servants' seats. In the
chancel are two large, high, family pews, one on
either side, the master and his sons occupying
one, and the lady and her daughters the other.</p>

<p class='c011' >The stained-glass window in the chapel was of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
great beauty, but, early in the nineteenth century,
the greater part of it was mysteriously stolen in
the night, and its place has been filled with fragments
of colored glass taken from other windows.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the kitchen may still be seen the immense
fireplace, the large, hollowed-out block, evidently
used for a chopping-tray, a salting-trough, and a
few other pieces of culinary apparatus.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the banqueting-hall is the minstrels' gallery,
the front of which is carved and paneled, and
decorated with stags' antlers, and there is also a
gallery along one side, probably of later construction.
The lord and his guests sat at one end of
the hall on a raised platform, while the retainers
sat at tables in the body of the hall. The high
table is a remarkable specimen of its kind, and
one of the most interesting relics of feudal times.</p>

<p class='c011' >At the north end of the hall, just inside the entrance,
is a kind of handcuff, fastened to the wall
and so arranged as to hold a man's wrist up at
arm's-length while liquor was poured down his
sleeve&mdash;the punishment meted out to every guest
who did not drink all that the laws of hospitality
forced upon him!</p>

<p class='c011' >Over the banqueting-hall is the drawing-room,
the walls still hung with ancient tapestries.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
There is a great deal of beautiful old tapestry in
Haddon Hall, and it all seems to be woven or
worked in small pieces, even the shades of coloring
being done separately and then sewed together.</p>

<p class='c011' >Another room shown to visitors is the state
bedroom, with old oil-paintings, and Goblin tapestry
designed in panels on the borders of which
are medallions with subjects from Æsop's fables.
Queen Elizabeth is said to have once slept in this
room, and in a large window-recess is a dressing-table
with a mirror called "Queen Elizabeth's
looking-glass." The poor queen's vanity must
have received a shock when she saw herself reflected
there, or else the glass has become defective
with age! In this room there is also the
primitive cradle said to be that of the first Duke
of Rutland.</p>

<p class='c011' >The state bed is large and imposing, draped
with faded green silk velvet lined with white
satin, dating from the reign of Henry VI. The
last person to occupy this bed was George IV,
when he was Prince Regent.</p>

<p class='c011' >There are some smaller and less interesting
rooms to which the visitor may have access, all,
by the small windows and the rude workmanship
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
of doors and fastenings, showing great antiquity.</p>

<p class='c011' >A winding staircase of uneven stone steps leads
to the Peveril Tower, the highest part of the Hall,
and from this tower there is a beautiful view of
the valley of the Wye and the hills and valleys
around.</p>

<p class='c011' >Haddon Hall is not used as a residence by its
owner, the Duke of Rutland, but it is kept in
reasonable repair, and is visited yearly by hundreds
of "trippers" from all parts of the British
Isles and by tourists from all countries.</p>

<p class='c011' >To be appreciated fully it should be inspected
leisurely, and not "done" in the few minutes allowed
some of the "personally conducted" visitors.
One lovely summer day we saw two large
wagonettes filled with tourists drive up to the
Hall, and the procession, headed by a guide,
walked through the rooms and back to the waiting
vehicles in less than half an hour! We
learned that these people were Americans, who
had landed at Liverpool that morning, and after
hastily viewing this fine old mansion, they were to
be taken to Chatsworth House, the Duke of Devonshire's
country-seat a few miles away, while
later in the day they were due in London for additional
sight-seeing!</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
It is small wonder if they had little appreciation
of the beauties of venerable pile or modern mansion,
and but the vaguest memories of them after
their return home!</p>

<p class='c011' >Haddon Hall will repay one for frequent and
extended visits, as new points of interest will repeatedly
reward the unhurried visitor, and many
a pleasant hour may be spent on the terraces,
looking out over the charming landscape and
dreaming of bygone days when the Hall was a
stage for the drama of life, with all its elements
of love and hate, of comedy and tragedy, of peace
and war.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>FOREIGN FIRE-BRIGADES</span><br /> <br />BY CHARLES T. HILL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >One summer, while in Switzerland, I asked
a prominent merchant of Lausanne, when
his town had had its last serious fire. "Not in
three years," he replied. I was moved to ask
this question because I had found the fire apparatus
in padlocked barns, or stations, with the keys
in the hands of the police, who attended to the
fire-fighting; and this seemed, as compared to the
remarkably quick methods employed in America,
a somewhat dangerous form of fire protection.
Lausanne is a town of about fifty thousand population,
and I wondered how many American cities
of a like size could boast of only one serious fire
in three years. Not many, I imagine.</p>

<p class='c011' >In Lucerne, a smaller city of Switzerland, of
about forty thousand population, the conditions
were practically the same, with the exception that
each stable containing the fire apparatus had a
notice posted on the door stating that the keys
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
could be found in the neighboring hotels and
drug-shops, and the citizens were expected to take
out the engines in the event of a fire, while the firemen
(volunteers) came on "call," the alarm being
sounded on all the church bells. Lucerne is a
well-known tourist center, heavily populated during
the summer months, and has many large
shops filled with very inflammable material, and
a great many very old buildings; and yet this
place had had only two fires of any size within
two years!</p>

<p class='c011' >While I was attending the morning drill of the
Central Fire Station at Dresden, in Saxony, the
captain in command told me that the city had, on
an average, about six alarms of fire a week. I
casually remarked that we had twenty-five <i>a day</i>
in New York. He looked at me with wonderment
and doubt, and when I repeated that we
actually had between twenty and thirty alarms
of fire a day in the Borough of Manhattan alone,
he threw up his hands and exclaimed, "Thank
heaven, it is not as bad as that here, or our beautiful
city would be destroyed!"</p>

<p class='c011' >And so we find, thanks to superior building
construction, less hurry and rush in business
methods, and a wholesome regard on the part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
the citizens for certain rigid laws covering the
use of explosives and materials of all kinds which
usually cause fire, the lot of the foreign firefighter
is not as strenuous as that of his brother fireman
on this side of the water. Because of the excellent
character of the buildings abroad fires
burn slowly, and rarely extend beyond the room
or floor in which they start. Here, on the other
hand, the conditions are entirely different. Our
fires are larger, more destructive, and more frequent,
compelling us to support not only the most
effective, but most expensive, fire-departments in
the world; and yet, in spite of all this, our annual
fire losses are from ten to twenty times more than
those of any country in Europe.</p>

<p class='c011' >Better building laws and the universal adoption
of fire-prevention ordinances, are going to change
all this for us, in time, but as yet our annual fire
loss stuns the average European by its enormous
total.</p>

<p class='c011' >In London, the fire-department comes under
the supervision of the city authorities, the London
County Council looking after the administration
of the "Metropolitan Fire-Brigade," as it is
called; and this brigade, in management and routine
work, is not unlike many large American fire-departments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
though the apparatus used is radically
different. A naval officer has always been
chief of the London fire-brigade, and the firemen
are usually recruited from the marine service, a
time-honored custom giving preference to men
who have been at least five years at sea. It is
argued that the work of a fireman is of a nature
more readily performed by a sailor, who is not
only accustomed to danger and exposure of all
kinds, but is trained to climbing and working in
perilous positions. These new men, after passing
a severe physical examination before a medical
board, are put through three months' careful
schooling at fire headquarters, where they are not
only taught how to handle every tool and implement
used in the brigade, but become skilled in
life-saving work.</p>

<p class='c011' >The fire stations in London are much larger
than the engine-houses found in American cities,
and some of the newer buildings in appearance
are not unlike some of our better-class apartment-houses.
Indeed, this is practically what they are&mdash;a
kind of apartment-house or barracks for the
men and their families, as well as a station for the
apparatus and the horses; and here the firemen
live, occupying little apartments of from three to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
five rooms, according to their rank and position.
They are, therefore, in the houses and on duty at
all times, with the exception of one day's leave
of absence in every fifteen. Enough firemen are
found in each London fire station to make up
three of our fire-companies, but only one third of
these men are in service or on "call-duty" at a
time, the rest being held in reserve to answer any
other alarms which might come in, or to reinforce
the first detachment leaving the house should
their "call" prove to be a bad fire. And the men
of each squad or detachment on "call-duty" are
supposed to be fully dressed when an alarm comes
in, and have only to adjust their helmets, which
hang in long rows on the walls of the apparatus
floor, before jumping on the engines; and no exception
is made to this rule, even with the men on
the last or "night tour"&mdash;from 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> until 7
<span class='fss'>A.M.</span> This accounts for the pictures we sometimes
see, showing the English firemen seated
along the sides of their engines, in military fashion,
fully uniformed.</p>

<p class='c011' >In some of the stations, the London fire-brigade
still clings to the rather old-fashioned custom of
keeping the horses standing in harness, in stables
at the rear, to be led out to the apparatus by hand
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
in event of a "call"; and this makes their "turnout"
in answer to an alarm appear to us to be a
peculiarly slow one, accustomed as we are to the
remarkably quick methods employed in our fire-departments.
But several of the newer houses,
built within the last few years, are supplied with
many ingenious American time-saving devices&mdash;sliding-poles,
swinging-harness, etc.,&mdash;while the
horses are kept in box-stalls on the apparatus
floor, in convenient running distance of the engines,
all of which has considerably reduced the
time consumed in turning out to an alarm.</p>

<p class='c011' >The English fire-engine is a small affair, much
smaller than our steam fire-engines, having about
one half the pumping capacity of the American
engines; and nearly every one in London is a combined
engine and hose-wagon,&mdash;the hose being
carried in a box-like compartment on each side of
the machine, just back of the driver's seat. This
"hose-box" serves as a convenient place for the
firemen to sit while riding to the fire. Quite a
number of automobile fire-engines are in service
in the London brigade, big, businesslike-looking
machines, about as large as some of our motor-engines,
and capable of great speed while answering
an alarm. As a contrast to this up-to-date
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_148' id='Page_148'>148</a></span>
equipment, a number of "manuals," or hand-engines,
are in use, which ought to have been sent
to the scrap-heap years ago.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the way of ladder-trucks they are very well
supplied in London, for, in addition to several
"horse ladder-escapes," as they are called (a
fairly long extension ladder carried on a horse-drawn
truck, and which can be detached from
this truck and pushed close to a building), they
have a great many hand-pushed "ladder-escapes"
(a shorter extension ladder of the same type and
pushed by hand) scattered throughout the city,
housed in substations in the principal squares and
more important thoroughfares, and intended for
emergency use only until the regular apparatus
arrives. They have also a few "aërial" ladder-trucks
carrying a very long extension ladder
which can be raised, by means of an ingenious
little engine using carbonic-acid gas for its motive
power, to a height of eighty feet or more.
But aside from use as a kind of water-tower at
large fires, these aërial ladders are rarely extended
to their full length, for the houses are
nearly all of a uniform height, not over five or six
floors, and the ordinary extension ladder is sufficiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
long to reach the upper parts of these
buildings.</p>

<p class='c011' >The fire-alarm boxes, or "alarm-points," as
they are known, are found at convenient corners
throughout London, and consist of an iron post
about as high as an ordinary hitching-post, with
a little round metal box at the top containing a
glass door. You break the glass in this door,
pull the little handle or knob inside, and thus send
in a "fire-call" to four or five of the nearest fire
stations. In all American cities when a fire-alarm
box is "pulled" the alarm is transmitted
direct to a central-bureau, usually at fire headquarters,
and is then retransmitted, either automatically
or by hand, to the engine-houses; but in
London&mdash;and in every other European city&mdash;each
fire station has its own alarm-bureau, in charge
of an officer and several operators, these stations
receiving only the alarms from the boxes
in the immediate neighborhood. All the stations,
however, are connected with each other, and with
a central-bureau or headquarters, by both telegraph
and telephone.</p>

<p class='c011' >London has something like 4000 fires annually,
and spends about $1,250,000 every year to support
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
her fire-brigade. It is estimated that the
city of New York (comprising the Boroughs of
Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Richmond,
and with about the same population as
London proper) has 12,500 fires annually, and
spends something over $7,500,000 to support her
fire-department.</p>

<p class='c011' >In Paris, the fire-brigade comes under the jurisdiction
of the Department of War, and it is part
of the French army that attends to the fire-fighting
in this famous city. Two battalions of infantry,
known as the "Regiment des Sapeurs
Pompiers," look after this important work, and
although this brigade is recruited, drilled, and
commanded by various regimental officers, from
a colonel down to a lieutenant, and belongs to the
war department, it comes under the direct control
of the Prefect of Police (Chief of Police), who
is the actual head of the Paris fire-brigade.</p>

<p class='c011' >These stations, or, as they are well named,
<i>casernes</i> (barracks), are big structures filled with
many firemen, on an average about 140 men in
every building; and each station is equipped with
numerous pieces of fire apparatus, and all are provided
with a large inner court, or drill-yard, in
which the men go through military evolutions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
twice daily, and where the new men, who are
coming into the brigade continually, are taught
how to handle all the various appliances used in
fire-fighting. Here also the men are put through
a series of calisthenic exercises two or three
times a week, which, if introduced into the American
fire-departments, would drive every man out
of the service, so vigorous are these "stunts." In
acrobatic fashion the Paris firemen are compelled
to climb ropes, jump hurdles, balance themselves
in mid-air on frail wooden supports, perform on
horizontal bars, execute a kind of "setting-up"
drill en masse, and last, but not least, climb up
one of the walls of the courtyard, holding on by
their finger-tips and the edges of their boots to
little crevices in the wall, and falling, if they
should slip, into a pile of sand at the bottom. In
addition to all this they have the regulation hose,
ladder, and life-saving drills of all other fire-departments.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Paris fire stations are thoroughly up to
date in equipment, for we find them fitted with
sliding-poles, swinging-harness, horses kept in
box-stalls within a pole's-length of the harness,
automatic door-openers, and virtually every
quick-hitching device for which American fire-departments
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
are noted. And in addition to steam
fire-engines, aërial ladder-trucks, and hose-wagons&mdash;the
latter very much of the same type as
those used in this country&mdash;there are a great
many automobile fire-engines in service, and quite
a few of the <i>casernes</i>, or stations, are equipped
entirely with motor-driven apparatus. There
are also several electric fire-engines in use, practical-looking
affairs, carrying a large square tank
containing four hundred gallons of water, which
is given the necessary pressure to reach the top
of any of the buildings by means of an ingenious
set of electric pumps placed at the back of the
tank. As it only requires a few men to handle
this engine, and the mere throwing over of a lever
to get it under way, it is used at many small fires,
and is sometimes the first and only piece of apparatus
to leave a station in answer to an alarm,
for there is no regular "assignment" of engines
and ladder-trucks sent to the alarm-boxes in
Paris, as is the case in our cities, and the operation
of their fire-alarm system differs from that
of any other city in the world.</p>

<p class='c011' >The fire-alarm boxes are large, ornate-looking
affairs, placed on the corners of the principal
boulevards and streets and in the public squares,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
and directions on the outside of these boxes inform
you that, in addition to breaking the glass
door (which automatically transmits the number
of the box to the nearest fire station), you must
also use the telephone inside and give a description
of the fire, its character, size, and location
(street number if possible); and it is necessary
to go through all this proceeding before the sending
of an alarm is considered complete. This
alarm is received in the alarm- or "watch-room,"
of the nearest fire station. There an operator
picks up a telephone receiver and listens for your
description of the fire, and he decides, according
to the message received, the number of pieces and
character of the apparatus which is to answer the
alarm. For example, if it is only a small fire&mdash;a
window-curtain or a chimney&mdash;he simply orders
out one piece of apparatus, an electric engine,
such as was described above, or, perhaps, a <i>fourgon</i>&mdash;a
sort of hose-wagon carrying a squad of
men, short ladders, hose, and tools and appliances
of all kinds. If, on the other hand, the call comes
from a factory or a tenement district, where rescue
work may be expected, he then sends two
wagon-loads of men and the <i>grande-echelle</i>
(aërial ladder-truck), and if the fire appears dangerous,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
from the telephoned description, another
ladder-truck and a steam fire-engine, or a motor-engine;
but the engines are rarely used in Paris,
as the water-pressure throughout the city is very
fine, sufficient to reach the top of the average
building; and the steamers are only sent out as a
precaution, and are seldom put to work.</p>

<p class='c011' >The fire-hydrants in Paris, as in every other
city in Europe, are of the "flush" or sunken character,
instead of the post-hydrants used in our
cities, and are found in depressed basins in the
sidewalk, near the curb, protected with iron covers;
and the location of these hydrants is carefully
indicated by metal signs on the walls of the
buildings near by, which not only point out the
exact position of each hydrant, but tell the amount
of water pressure to be found at that outlet&mdash;a
feature that our firemen would welcome.</p>

<p class='c011' >All gas or electricity entering any building in
Paris comes partially under the control of the
fire-brigade, and the firemen carry keys on every
piece of apparatus which enables them to open a
small metal plate, always found at a certain spot
in the sidewalks, and thus cut off either the gas
or electric service from the building immediately
on their arrival at a fire.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
But in addition to this very sensible supervision
of the gas and electric service by the fire-brigade,
the Paris firemen have the added protection in
their work of a very effective type of "smoke-helmet,"
a device which is also used largely by
the fire-brigades of Berlin, Dresden, Vienna,
Milan, and several other cities in Europe. This
is a metal helmet fastening securely around the
neck of the fireman wearing it, and connected
by means of an endless hose-pipe, with a portable
air-pump kept out in the street and in charge of
a fellow-fireman, who controls the amount of
fresh air reaching the head-piece. It is claimed
that, protected with this device, a fireman can
enter a heavily smoke-charged building and work
for quite a while in comparative comfort. We
carry a smoke-helmet on nearly all the fire apparatus
in this country, somewhat similar to the
European appliance, but without the independent
air-pump attachment. It is rarely used, however,
as our firemen claim that it is unreliable, and
hampers rather than aids them in their work.
But among the foreign firemen the smoke-helmet
is considered a valuable protection, and is used
frequently.</p>

<p class='c011' >Among other interesting appliances which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
Paris firemen have found of great assistance to
them in their work there may be mentioned a
portable electric search-light, carried like an ordinary
hand-lantern, fitted with a powerful storage
battery, and producing a very intense, and, of
course, a thoroughly safe light. It is used largely
for night work or in dark, smoky cellars. Also a
large hand-carried electric fan, which can be operated
by hydraulic power as well as electricity,
using the pressure from the street hydrants for
this purpose; and this fan has been found useful
for clearing rooms or hallways of heavy smoke
or poisonous vapors.</p>

<p class='c011' >Paris, with a population of 2,750,000 souls, has
about 1800 fires every year, and spends, annually,
$575,000 to support her fire-brigade, an organization
of some eighteen hundred men which can be
turned into the field as two battalions of infantry
at short notice. Therefore this expenditure
might be said to provide two kinds of protection&mdash;military
as well as civic. But splendid building
laws and equally excellent laws covering the
use and storage of explosives and inflammable
materials of all kinds, have made the work of her
firemen a comparatively easy one, and the large
fire is of such rare occurrence in this famous city
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
that the "French Pompier," using methods which
appear very amusing to American visitors, is enabled
to make a most satisfactory yearly showing
to his Minister of War.</p>

<p class='c011' >In Berlin, and in virtually every other German
city, the fire-brigade is managed upon almost the
same general plan as the brigades found in London
and Paris, and the apparatus, in nearly every
instance of German manufacture, is very similar
to that used by the English and French firemen.
The men are all husky fellows, well drilled and
military in appearance, and the majority are ex-soldiers,
as preference is given to men who have
seen army service in recruiting new members for
the brigade. The fire stations are usually very
large, sometimes occupying as much space as
would be covered by an entire block in an American
city, and nearly all of the stations are built in
rectangular form, with a spacious inner court,
or drill-yard, in the middle. On one side of this
yard will be found the engines, ladder-trucks, etc.,
housed in individual compartments, or barns, and
on the other the stables for the horses; while the
upper part of the building on both sides is occupied
as dormitories or lounging-rooms for the
men, and quarters for the officers. Every station
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
has its own fire alarm-bureau, or "watch-room,"
looked after by an officer and two or three operators.
The "turnout" in answer to an alarm in a
German fire station is very similar to an artillery
drill, and is performed in the same stiff, almost
automatic, manner, for the brigades are conducted
on strict military lines.</p>

<p class='c011' >The men in these stations are divided into little
squads, each commanded by a petty officer, or
<i>Oberfeuerwehrmann</i>, as he is called, and each
squad placed in charge of a separate piece of apparatus.
When an alarm strikes in the "watch-room,"
a bell is started ringing in the quarters of
the men, which sends them clattering down the
long flight of stairs in their heavy leather boots,
while they hastily adjust coats, belts, and helmets.
Reaching the yard, each squad breaks up into two
detachments, two men, the driver and his aide,
running to the stable for the horses, the rest for
their respective pieces of apparatus. The doors
of the apparatus barns are thrown open, and the
engines, ladder-trucks, and wagons are found
standing there with poles detached, the latter
lying on the floor directly under each machine.
At a command given by the petty officer the pole
is lifted up, shoved back in its socket, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
king-pin dropped into place. The men then jump
back to the wheels at each side, and at another
command the apparatus is pushed out into the
yard. By this time, the horses, fully harnessed,
have been brought over from the stables by the
other two men, and are backed into position beside
the pole, the traces and pole-straps are locked,
and at another command from the petty officer
the driver and the rest of the men jump into their
places on top of the apparatus, and salute the
<i>Brandmeister</i>, or commanding officer, of the station.
This official, leisurely getting into a six-seated
wagon with his associate officers, then
gives the order to "go," and, headed by the wagon
containing the chief and his aides, the procession
dashes out through the arched driveway into the
main thoroughfare, thus completing an exhibition
which, when witnessed by Americans, usually
provokes a laugh. And when I add that upon
the receipt of an alarm in the "watch-room" the
location of the box is written down on a large
yellow paper blank, bearing the word "Feuer!"
at its top; that this blank is folded carefully and
sent down to the apparatus floor by means of a
small hand-lift, or elevator; that it is taken therefrom
by the commanding officer and read deliberately
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
before he steps into his <i>feuer-wagon</i>, it will
be seen that the Germans believe in attending to
everything, even a call as urgent as an alarm of
fire, in a thoroughly official and dignified manner.
But in Berlin much of this military detail and
pomp has been done away with, and, aided by
swinging-harness and many other quick-hitching
devices, the firemen make a more rapid exit in answer
to a call. And once in the streets, they
cover the ground at great speed, for the engines
are light and the horses splendid, and every one,
even the Kaiser himself, gives a clear field to the
<i>Feuerwehr</i>.</p>

<p class='c011' >It costs the Berliners, with not quite the population
of Paris, $485,000 a year to maintain their
excellent fire-brigade, excellent because the fire
loss in this royal city is hardly more than a fifth
of that in New York. But much of this remarkably
low loss in the German capital is due to the
careful work of the brigade in preventing any
damage to property other than that caused by the
actual extinguishment of the fire. As an example
of the conscientious way in which the Berlin
firemen attend to their labors, it may be explained
that, at fires in the residential districts, where it
is found possible to confine the fire to some one

room, tarpaulins, or waterproof covers, are
spread over the stairs and through the halls before
the hose is brought into the house, and no
windows are broken unless absolutely necessary.
When our buildings are all as excellent as theirs,
and our citizens are all working as harmoniously

adopt some of the deliberate and careful methods
of the German firemen.</p>

  <h2 id='ch13' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>DUTCH CHEESES</span><br /> <br />BY H. M. SMITH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Among the daintiest and best of the numerous
kinds of foreign and domestic cheeses
that may be bought in nearly every American city
and town, are the small round cheeses with red or
yellow coats which come to our markets from
Holland. The ancient town of Edam, on the
shore of the Zuyder Zee, has given its name to
this product, and almost everywhere in America
we ask for Edam cheese when we want this particular
kind; but while Edam produces Edam
cheese, this sleepy little town long ago ceased to
hold a high place in the cheese world, and neighboring
towns now monopolize the trade in this
article, which holds a leading place in the farm
products of Holland.</p>

<p class='c011' >The most extensive and celebrated of the
cheese-markets is that of Alkmaar, which has the
commercial advantage of being located on a railroad
as well as on the North Holland Canal.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
Every visitor to the Netherlands should arrange
to spend at least one day at Alkmaar, easily
reached from Amsterdam or Haarlem.</p>

<p class='c011' >In Dutch history, Alkmaar is celebrated for its
successful defense when besieged by the Spaniards
in 1573, but in modern times it has been
noted for its cheese trade, which is now its principal
attraction.</p>

<p class='c011' >The market is held every Friday; but in order
to observe all of its features, a visitor should go
to Alkmaar the day before, and see the preliminary
preparations. The market-place is a large
stone-paved space in the open air, with business
houses on three sides, a canal on the fourth side,
and a weigh-house at one end. During Thursday
the dairymen from the surrounding country
arrive with their families and their cheeses, coming
in carts, wagons, and canal-boats; and by the
afternoon of that day, there is a great bustle,
which continues far into the evening.</p>

<p class='c011' >Throughout the night bands of young peasants,
both men and women, parade the streets of Alkmaar,
singing and skylarking; and cheese-carts
continue to arrive and clatter along the stony
streets, so that little sleep is possible for the residents
and visitors.</p>

<p class='c011' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
An essential part of the cheese-market is the
official weigh-house, which was built more than
three centuries ago, out of an already existing
church. Its shapely clock-tower has moving figures
of horsemen in a tourney, and a beautiful
set of chimes, one of whose airs is the well-known
wedding march from Wagner's "Lohengrin."
In the main room on the ground floor
are four huge balances which, before the opening
of the market, are carefully adjusted with
much ceremony by an official in silk hat and
frock-coat.</p>

<p class='c011' >When the cheeses are on their way to market
from the farms, they are handled with great care,
so as to prevent bruising or crushing; and
whether in wagons or boats, they are arranged in
layers separated by light boards. As the wagons
and boats arrive at the market-place, spaces are
assigned to them, and the unloading begins, the
cheeses being arranged in regular square or oblong
piles on pieces of canvas, with narrow walks
between. The size of the piles depends on the
number of cheeses the individual farmers have to
dispose of, but usually the piles are eight to ten
cheeses wide, thirty to fifty long, and always two
layers deep. At the market attended by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
writer, the largest pile contained nine hundred
cheeses.</p>

<p class='c011' >The unloading of the wagons and boats is one
of the most interesting sights of the market.
Standing in a wagon or boat, one man takes a
cheese in each hand and throws them to another
man, sitting or kneeling on the ground, who arranges
the cheeses in regular piles. Long practice
has made the farmers very skilful in tossing
and catching; the cheeses go through the air in
pairs as though tied together, and may be thrown
as far as thirty feet. During very active times,
the yellow balls are flying thickly in all directions.</p>

<p class='c011' >As soon as a farmer has arranged his stock of
cheeses, he covers the piles with canvas, and often
also with rush mats, grass, or straw, in order to
protect them from sun or rain, and to prevent the
drying of the surface. Before the sale, the
venders liberally anoint the cheeses with oil to
make them look fresh and inviting.</p>

<p class='c011' >Shortly before ten o'clock a large number of
aged porters meet in a room of the weigh-house,
and soon emerge dressed in scrupulously clean
white trousers and shirts, with black slippers and
straw hats. The hats are of blue, green, yellow,
red, or other bright colors, with ribbons of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
same shade hanging down behind; and the men
wearing the same colors work together in pairs.</p>

<p class='c011' >Promptly as the clock in the weigh-house tower
strikes the hour of ten, the cheese-market formally
opens. The covers are removed from the
piles of cheeses, and the whole market-place literally
bursts into bloom. Sales are preceded by
much bargaining, and the cheeses are felt,
smelled, and tasted. When a price is agreed
upon for a particular lot, the buyer and the seller
clasp hands; and then, the half-hour having
struck, the porters begin their labors, which consist
in carrying to the weigh-house loads of
cheeses on sled-like trays suspended from their
shoulders by long straps, receiving a check from
the master of the scales, and returning their certified
fares to the owners, who thus have a basis
for determining the aggregate weight and value
of each lot sold.</p>

<p class='c011' >So rapidly do the selling and weighing proceed
that by eleven o'clock the market is virtually over.
Then the cheeses are removed to the warehouses
of the purchasing merchants, the farmers depart
in their boats and wagons, and when the grand
noonday burst of the chimes comes the Alkmaar
cheese-market exists only as a memory.</p>

  <h2 id='ch14' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>A GEOGRAPHY CITY "COME ALIVE"</span><br /> <br />BY LINDAMIRA HARBESON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >During the Great War, when the armies of
Europe were trying to beat their way into
Constantinople, this city, which once had been
to us merely a black dot in our geographies, suddenly
became very real. We used to know it as
a point somewhere in the lower right-hand corner
of the map, where Europe is separated from Asia
by several annoying little bodies of water that
were so hard for us to remember. But when I
tell you that I ate a bag of peanuts while going
in a ferry-boat to Constantinople from Scutari,
the little Asiatic village just opposite, you will understand
the width of the Bosporus better, perhaps,
than your geography can tell you.</p>

<p class='c011' >The photograph presents a good general view
of the city as seen from the Galata side; and
shows clearly Santa Sophia and the Golden Horn
which divides in two parts this ancient and famous
metropolis of the Ottoman Empire. From the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
roof of the American College buildings, which
are on a hill in Scutari, we can look directly across
toward the mouth of the Golden Horn.</p>

<p class='c011' >Stamboul is the old part of the city, where
many different peoples have dwelt&mdash;first Greeks,
then Romans, now Turks, and you can still see
by a bit of a house or an old wall how these people
lived. Galata is where English, French, Italians,
and Germans carry on their business in
Turkey, and where the big boats unload their cargoes.
Between Galata and Stamboul is one of
the most famous and most crowded bridges in
the world. Pera is where most of the Europeans
live.</p>

<p class='c011' >Constantinople is indeed like the fairy city in
the Arabian Nights to which the poor brothers
are whisked away on a carpet&mdash;a dream city on
the edge of the water&mdash;a city of lavender-blue
domes, and minarets that seem to reach to the
sky. We are just aware of the little houses
straggling up the hill or dipping their feet in the
water. The maze of houses and the mosques are
veiled in a light blue haze, just as if the city,
like the women, had to wear the <i>yachmak</i>, or
head-covering. Off beyond is the glistening Sea
of Marmora, and near by, the dazzling blue
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
waters of the Bosporus dotted with little black
boats. The city stretches on farther up the shore,
and just beyond are the wooded hills. At the
foot of one of them, on the very edge of the
water, is the long low white marble palace of the
sultan&mdash;Dolmah Bagtché it is called, which
means "walled-in garden."</p>

<p class='c011' >Everybody who is young must love Constantinople.
It is so full of color and soft musical
sounds that one is sure something unexpected and
wonderful will happen any moment. Nowhere
in the world, perhaps, can be seen so many different
types of people as on Galata Bridge. Let us
pay ten paras&mdash;a little over one cent&mdash;and go on
the bridge; we shall see and hear more than a
dollar's worth. There go modern Turkish gentlemen
dressed like our fathers, but wearing
fezzes instead of hats. A fez is made of soft red
felt and has no brim; from the top hangs a black
silk tassel. Here come old-fashioned Turkish
gentlemen with bent shoulders and flowing
beards. They wear soft padded overcoats of
many colors, and each is sure to have on a ring
set with a beautiful stone that he keeps turned
toward the inside of his hand. There are some
priests with white scarfs round their fezzes; here
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
are others with green ones, because they have
been to Mecca, where every pious Turk wants to
go before he dies. There are whirling dervishes
in brown overcoats, and tall brown hats shaped
like chicken croquettes. Have you ever heard
of dervishes? They are priests who perform a
peculiar ceremony in their religious houses.
They take off their brown overcoats and dance in
green or white costumes that have full pleated
skirts. They spin round and round on their tiptoes,
accompanied by strange music, while the
chiefs of the order sit cross-legged on the floor
and watch them.</p>

<p class='c011' >Then there may pass a Tartar pilgrim all in
white from the interior of Asiatic Turkey, or a
Persian in gray with a Persian-lamb fez, or a
fierce Kurd. The last is a soldier, and wears a
brown hood with a long end knotted round his
head. Since the Balkan War, when many Kurds
were in Constantinople on their way to the army,
the little Turkish girls have worn the same sort
of hood of soft colors and fabrics. On the
bridge, too, may be seen the shrouded Turkish
ladies, who move silently along like black ghosts.
They wear the <i>tcharchaf</i>&mdash;the modern Turkish
dress which includes a veil over the face; old-fashioned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
women of the poorer class still wear the
soft white yachmak that covers the head but not
the face. And then, too, there are the <i>hamals</i>&mdash;wild
peasants from the interior&mdash;who do the
fetching and carrying. They wear little caps and
bright sashes, and have on their backs a kind of
saddle on which they put anything from a bag of
flour to a piano. They walk faster than the rest
and sing "<i>Dustur</i>, <i>dustur</i>," which means "Get out
of the road." If we are very lucky, we shall see
a string of camels with their noses in the air, and
on their humps lovely faded blue and red saddle-bags.
They are usually led by a donkey, and with
them is a camel-driver of most fetching appearance.
The camels are so big and shaggy and
out of place that we pinch ourselves to see if we
are really awake.</p>

<p>View of Constantinople from the Galata side</p>
</div>

<p class='c011' >Now let us go wandering about the old city.
The narrow, silent streets are paved with cobblestones,
and lined with houses that have never
been painted, but have been colored by the sun,
the rain, and the wind. Some of them are overgrown
with wistaria vines that cross from one
side of the street to the other and frame the big
shut front door.</p>

<p class='c011' >One fine day I lifted the knocker on one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
these doors when calling on a Turkish family I
knew. The door was opened silently, and I found
myself in a tiny garden full of flowers. No matter
how small his house, the Turk always has a
bit of a garden. If he is rich, he has it on a hill
from which he can see the Bosporus. The garden
I visited opened from a bricked hall. We
went up the stairs and were greeted by the ladies
of the family more courteously and gracefully
than I ever have been greeted anywhere else. I
wish I could describe for you the Turkish salutation.
It is as hard to acquire as a foreign accent.
As she bows, a lady makes a downward
sweep with her arm, then raises her hand, palm
upward, to her heart and lips. This means, "I
am at your service; my heart is yours; the words
that I speak are in your favor."</p>

<p class='c011' >I was taken into a room all windows. The
Turk loves windows as he loves gardens&mdash;windows
that look over the water. All around the
room were bright-colored <i>sedias</i>,&mdash;low hard
couches,&mdash;which are, however, very comfortable
to sit or lie upon. In the middle of the room on
a brass tray was a big brazier containing live
coals, on which the daughter of the house soon
made Turkish coffee. Besides gardens and windows,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
the Turk loves coffee&mdash;his own peculiar
kind that you must taste some day along with
the other goodies. This is the way it was made
for me: Into a brass coffee-maker, which looks
like a pitcher with a long handle, were put one
sugar lump and one coffee-cupful of water.
When this had boiled, one teaspoonful of finely
powdered Turkish coffee, taken from a china egg
on the tray, was put into the water. This mixture
was allowed to come to a boil three times and
then poured, the pitcher being held a foot from
the cup so that there would be foam on the coffee.
I tried to drink it in the really Turkish way,
holding the saucer with the cup to my lips. If
you try it, you will see how <i>hard</i> it is to do this
<i>easily</i>!</p>

<p class='c011' >A little sister showed us her drawing-book, in
which she had begun at the back and worked toward
the front. The Turkish children recite
their lessons all together in the old-fashioned
schools, and if you could hear them, you would
think that you had gone into <i>Wonderland</i> with
<i>Alice</i> where "things wouldn't come straight."
The little girls go to school in groups, and with
them is always an old servant who carries all
their books on what looks for all the world like a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
small clothes-tree. The boys go and come in two
long lines, attended by their teacher. They carry
their own books and wear long trousers and
fezzes exactly like those of their fathers. Some
of the tiny girls carry their own little tables and
drawing-boards. In the gipsy village in Scutari
the children learn their lessons by songs in the
street. They stand in a circle with a big girl in
the middle, and they grow noisier and noisier
the more interested they become. These little
girls wear <i>shelvars</i>, which look like little trousers
gathered in at the ankle. I tried to take a picture
of a little girl in an orange-colored pair and of
a boy in a wrapper and fez, but they were frightened
and ran away crying.</p>

<p class='c011' >Now I must tell you about the Turkish shops&mdash;the
really Turkish ones. Most of them are about
the size of a spider's parlor and have no front
wall, so you see the wares can be temptingly displayed
to the passer-by. You see in one of our
pictures a shop where all kinds of blankets and
scarfs are sold. The scarfs are especially useful:
if you are a man, you can wind one around your
fez or your waist; if you are a lady, you can wear
it indoors as a shawl, sash, or scarf; or, if it is the
right kind, a little girl can wear it to school on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
her head. You don't know which one to choose
when they are tossed down in front of you&mdash;a
riotous mingling of reds, browns, oranges, golds,
and yellows. Another fascinating shop is a bead-shop.
Most of them are together on the bead
street. There you may see displayed all kinds of
strings of beads&mdash;long and short, large and small
beads, red, yellow, and blue, of amber, meerschaum,
and olive-wood. The Turkish gentlemen
carry the short strings, and, when they chat,
they play with the beads, unconsciously, but always
in the same way. They move them forward
with the thumb and first finger, two at a
time, one from each side of the string. When
all have been moved, they turn the string about
and move the beads in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class='c011' >Then there is the rug-shop. The Turkish rug-merchant
offers you tea or coffee and cigarettes,
as he hopes you will spend much money. And
while you drink, he throws down before you rugs,
rugs, rugs, soft, rich, alluring, from Baluchistan,
Kurdistan, Persia.</p>

<p class='c011' >But you, I am sure, would prefer a candy-shop.
Even if you have tasted our Turkish paste, you
have only a remote idea of how succulent a goody
the real <i>loukoumi</i> is. Then there is <i>halva</i>, full
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
of nuts and all sorts of other good things which
you can never guess. It is sticky, and, when you
bite it, it nearly pulls your teeth out. Then there
are <i>courabiés</i> and <i>smits</i>, both of which are cakes
which you must buy on a ferry-boat to get the real
flavor. A man comes in, carrying a basket in one
hand and waving a sheet of paper in the other.
The <i>courabiés</i> are stuck to this paper and you pull
them off yourself. The <i>smits</i> are on a stick
which protrudes from the top of the basket. For
you must know that a <i>smit</i> is shaped like a doughnut.
(Only the hole has grown larger without
affecting the size of the eatable part.
This part is not sweet and is covered with
aniseed.)</p>

<p class='c011' >It would make your mouth water if I should
tell you of all the delectable dishes you might
have in the cafés all over the city. The Turk
loves to eat, he loves to sit, and he loves to stare
at his garden, at his beloved Bosporus, or at space.
They never say in Turkey, "Where do you live?"
but always, "Where do you sit?" In spring and
autumn the hills about Constantinople are dotted
with spots of color. They are the Turkish men
and women sitting on the grass. And what a
wonderful view they look at! There they sit for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
hours and hours, usually silent, occasionally chatting,
sometimes grunting "<i>Uh, uh, uh, uh</i>," in descending
tones.</p>

<p class='c011' >The chief other thing a Turk does in times of
peace is to pray. From the gallery of a minaret
the muezzin calls him to prayer five times a day.
Do you know what a minaret is? It is the tower
of the Turkish church, or mosque. Mosques
built by royalty may have two minarets, others
only one. These minarets are slender, very tall,
with a gracefully pointed top that draws the eye
right up to the sky. There is a Turkish proverb
that says, "Never steal a minaret unless you have
a place to hide it in." Two thirds of the way up,
there is a carved gallery, very light and beautiful,
where the priest stands and chants down through
the air the call to prayer, which in English prose
is this: "There is no God but Allah; Mohammed
is His Prophet; let us go and pray; let us go save
our souls; God is great; there is no god but God."
A pious Turk either goes to the mosque, or prays
wherever he may happen to be. I once saw a soldier
praying on a ferry-boat. Inside the mosques
the cooing of many pigeons adds to the rhythmic
murmur of the prayers. There are pigeons inside
and outside of all the mosques; one, of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
a picture is here shown, is called the Pigeon
Mosque.</p>

<p class='c011' >The most famous mosque of all is Santa
Sophia, once a Christian church as you can tell by
its name, built by the Byzantine Greeks about
300 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> It is yellow, weathered by time, is very
big and on top of a hill. Inside, it is a dark
golden-brown, and the pigeons flying around under
the roof seem to be far, far above you. The
rugs on the floor are all on a slant because the
church was built originally with the altar toward
the east; later the Moslems made it face toward
Mecca, southeast of Constantinople. No Turk
ever walks on those rugs with his shoes on,&mdash;he
leaves them at the door or carries them in his
hand,&mdash;and before he comes in to pray, he washes
his feet and hands at the fountain outside, no
matter how cold the water or the weather. Fountains
are everywhere in Constantinople, made of
white marble and exquisitely carved.</p>

<p class='c011' >Constantinople has been famous in history ever
since the legend that Leander died in swimming
the Hellespont, the old name of the Dardanelles.
Nations have quarreled over it, because it is one
of the most wonderfully situated cities in the
world, and Constantine the Great made it the capital
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
of his huge empire. You will study all that
in Roman history if you have not studied it already,
and will read also of its capture by the
Turks, under Mohammed the Conqueror, nearly
five hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c011' >The history of the Ottoman Empire makes the
most exciting fairy tale seem colorless. Perhaps
you do not know that, when Henry the Eighth of
England and Francis the First of France were
forming a mutual-admiration society of their two
kingdoms on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, there
was another king, as great as either of them, in
the southeast of Europe, carving great pieces out
of other countries for his empire. This sultan,
Suleiman the Magnificent, was a great lawgiver.
His reign was the height of Turkey's power.
Soon after its close the rest of Europe became interested
in Turkey, especially Russia and England.
Recently, German influence has been
stronger than any other at the Turkish court.
That is why Turkey fought on the side of Germany,
and why England and France determined
to storm the forts and brave the mines in the
water entrances to Constantinople and so open up
a way to the Mediterranean for their great ally,
Russia.</p>

  <h2 id='ch15' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>THE GIANT AND THE GENIE</span><br /> <br />BY GEORGE FREDERIC STRATTON</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >Far up on the slopes of Mt. Rainier, in Washington,
is a waterfall which, according to the
legend, was inhabited by a giant of enormous
strength&mdash;Menuhkesen by name. From out of
the East there came a genie possessed of such
courage and audacity that when he was warned
against the terrible powers of Menuhkesen he
laughed lustily and said that he would call forth
the surly giant and make him do his bidding.
Summoning his afrits, he gave them orders, and
they immediately surrounded the falls, some of
them peering through strange instruments and
making mysterious signs with their hands, while
others measured distances and drove stakes, bearing
weird symbols, into the river banks.</p>

<p class='c011' >Then the genie stood on the bank overlooking
the falls and shouted: "Ho, afrits! Dig me
here a deep hole!" And immediately they went
to work with great activity. When they had dug
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
down a hundred feet, the genie commanded them
to tunnel under the falls. "We will unearth this
giant and prove his strength!" he cried defiantly.</p>

<p class='c011' >So they dug a tunnel until they reached a great
mass of rock underneath the brink of the falls;
and here they hewed out a huge cavern, and carried
into it strange machines and many wheels,
fastening them all strongly. And they hung
wires from those machines, stringing them a long
distance through dense woods and across ghostly
ravines to where many men lived and worked.
When all was ready the genie grasped a great
lever and shouted, "Ho, Menuhkesen! Come
forth now, and get busy!"</p>

<p class='c011' >Then he pressed down the lever, and instantly
the spirit sprang out of the falls, and leaping
upon a wire, rushed along it with such swiftness
that no one could see him. The next moment he
was many miles away, performing marvelous
feats of strength&mdash;pushing great street-cars at
incredible speed, turning the wheels in mills and
factories, and lighting stores and dwellings. In
fact, he did whatever the genie ordered him to
do, without an instant's delay or any demur.</p>

<p class='c011' >All over these big, resourceful United States,
Menuhkesen is found, but the modern captains of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
industry call him "Electricity." The genii also
are with us, graduates of technical colleges or of
engineering departments of great factories, who,
donning khaki clothes and high-laced leather
boots, camp out in the wild mountain fastnesses,
or on the weird deserts, or in the dense forests,
and invoke the giants they meet everywhere in
this wonderful country.</p>

<p class='c011' >But it is the western mountain regions which
chiefly hold the romance, the tragedy, and the
gigantic power of the mythical old giant. All up
and down the Rockies and the Sierras, and in
the network of stupendous mountains which cross
the five or six hundred miles between, are mountain
torrents tearing down from summits perhaps
two or three thousand feet high to the valleys below.
Some of them are very small in appearance,
but possessed of tremendous force.</p>

<p class='c011' >Let us trace one of these and discover the
giant. We hike, or ride a sure-footed horse, six
miles up one of the somber gashes in the mountains,
called cañons, arriving at the origin of a
stream we have seen growing smaller as we
ascended. We find a little spring gushing from
beneath a huge boulder and trickling down
through the ferns and brush. Soon it is joined
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
by other little streams on the right or left. Presently,
as we stumble along down the rocky trail,
we see on one side a wide, deep gulch, with walls
of sandstone or granite rising almost perpendicularly
on either side. And that gulch has snow
lying in it, perhaps forty feet deep&mdash;the drifts
of last winter or slides from the slopes above it.</p>

<p class='c011' >The snow may then have been sixty or a hundred
feet deep, but now, in midsummer, it is
dwindling fast, and its water doubles or triples
the size of our little stream. Suddenly we see
that the wild, rocky, torrent bed has been cleaned
out, and that the banks are lined up with rock.
The genie has been giving orders.</p>

<p class='c011' >A few rods farther that torrent bed gives place
to a timber flume; and the next moment that
flume, instead of keeping on the sharply sloping
floor of the cañon, rises on trestles, holding an
almost level position. The trestle increases in
height as the ground beneath them slopes downward,
and cross a deep gulch, still holding the
little torrent running between the wooden walls
of the flume.</p>

<p class='c011' >From our trail beneath we see the flume now
skirting round the waist of some stupendous
mountain, then crossing other gulches, and soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
appearing on the summit of a peak, eight hundred
feet above where we are standing. Below,
at the foot of that peak, is a small, plain, stone
building, and, wriggling down from the summit,
is, apparently, a huge black snake, poking its nose
into the basement of that house.</p>

<p class='c011' >The house holds the generators for turning
the force of that torrent into electricity. The
snake is the penstock&mdash;a great black steel pipe,
twisting and turning to avoid the huge boulders
in its path as it conducts that water from the
summit into the turbines in the house.</p>

<p class='c011' >The turbine is an enclosed water-wheel in
which every particle of force in the rushing water
is used to turn a great steel shaft. On the other
end of that shaft is geared the generator&mdash;the
wonderful machine with wire-wound arms which
makes the electric current. At this particular
power-house the little torrent which reaches the
summit in a flume thirty inches wide and two feet
deep turns out 800 horse-power.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is the force, not the size, of the stream which
gives that power, for water has a pressure of
about fifty pounds per square inch for every hundred
feet of the height of its source. So this
water has a pressure at the turbine of four hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
pounds per square inch&mdash;a far greater pressure
than that in the cylinders of a great Mogul
mountain locomotive.</p>

<p class='c011' >The little stream, freed from the turbines,
whirls furiously round a small basin and rollicks
off on a wild, headlong dash through an open
sluiceway for a short distance. Then another
flume arrests it; and as we hike along down the
trail, that flume rises above us, straddling gulches
on high trestles, and at two points tunneling
through a great mountain.</p>

<p class='c011' >We get back to the mouth of the cañon, and
there see, on the level we have then reached, another
power-house, larger than the first. Behind
it is another huge, bare mountain of rock; and
coming down that, another gigantic black snake,
also poking its head into the power-house. This
snake&mdash;or penstock&mdash;is 1600 feet long, and the
same stream which developed 800 horse-power at
the upper house is now&mdash;with the addition of a
little water picked up on the way&mdash;reeling off
2600 horse-power at this house.</p>

<p class='c011' >This imprisoned, raging torrent is now released,
and flows in a subdued, gentle stream
down a natural stream-bed. It is less than eight
feet wide and not deep enough to wet our horses'
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
knees as we ford across. But we gaze upon it
with the awe and amazement it deserves when we
remember that, but a few moments before, it has
sent its great power over eleven miles of wire to
a small town, is operating several factories, and
will, at night, light all the streets and the houses.</p>

<p class='c011' >And that is only half its work! Before us is a
great stretch of orchards and fields, vividly green,
although they have not had one drop of water
from the heavens for three or four months. All
their health and vigor and wonderful productivity
is due to that little stream, which irrigates over
three thousand acres of the land.</p>

<p class='c011' >Within twenty miles of where this is written,
at the foot of the great Wasatch Mountains, in
Utah, are five such cañons with power-houses&mdash;two
of them with two houses in each cañon. All
over this mountain country, from the middle of
Utah to the Canadian line, are hundreds of such
mountain torrents, only a small proportion of
which are yet harnessed for work.</p>

<p class='c011' >Some of them are very much larger than the
one we have visited. Come with me to one of
these larger houses.</p>

<p class='c011' >It is in a cañon of awful sublimity, so deep and
so nearly unapproachable that the construction
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
teams had to haul over eight miles of zigzag trail
to make the descent of less than half a mile to the
torrent. We scramble down over the rocks and
brush; and although the roar of the water reaches
us for ten or fifteen minutes before we see it, we
are by no means prepared for the astounding
scene when it at last comes into view.</p>

<p class='c011' >Out from the depths of the great ugly building
belch forth four gleaming, horizontal columns of
water, big as barrels, with a force, speed, and roar
as though the discharge were from giant cannon.
Straight across the tail-race they gleam and
quiver for a hundred feet, impinging upon a solid
ledge of granite, in which they have worn huge
caverns. The spray dashes up the face of the
ledge for sixty or seventy feet. Up and down
the stream, swirling and writhing in a thousand
rushing, crowding whirlpools, the water, just
freed from its maddening confinement, is seeking
to make good its escape. But it is jammed back
into the upper race, and for fifty yards you will
see it hanging, ledge upon ledge, fighting, snarling,
surging, and struggling for its chance to slip
beneath those terrific outlet volleys and gain the
lower stream and liberty and peace.</p>

<p class='c011' >The mighty Niagara has no such background
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
of wild beauty, nor does it ever convey such an
instant impression of water force. Once I saw
a big two-inch plank dropped into one of those
furious water columns. It seemed scarcely to
touch the water, but flew, faster than the eye
could follow, over to the granite ledge and was
instantly smashed into ten thousand splinters, and
I knew that even before the plank had reached
the ledge, the mighty power which hurled it,
transmuted into electricity, had already reached,
and was operating, street-cars in a city seventy
miles away.</p>

<p class='c011' >Come into the power-house. Look at the four
gigantic generators, whirling and humming like
leviathan June-bugs&mdash;see the wicked, sputtering
little blue sparks from the commutators. From
the windows at the back of the building we look
up a very sharp slope, 1500 feet high, and see the
penstocks&mdash;twenty-four-inch steel tubes, black,
ungainly, and, at twilight, very uncanny. They
follow in curves the profile of the rough ground,
bringing the furious rush of water from the summit
down to the turbines in the lower basement,
turning out 26,000 horse-power.</p>

<p class='c011' >The force of the water in these penstocks is
terrific. Tests of a four-inch jet from one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
them have been made. A rifle-bullet glances off
as from chilled steel; a jet from it, no bigger than
a penholder, will drill a hole in sheet steel in a
few moments. At the reservoir on the summit a
fly-line may be played in the water&mdash;at the foot of
the penstock no mortal could thrust a bayonet one
inch into it.</p>

<p class='c011' >A United States trooper once essayed, on a
wager, to cut a two-inch jet with his sword;
a shattered weapon and a broken wrist
resulted.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the harnessing and curbing of these mountain
streams the utmost engineering skill and ingenuity
has been called into play. Often the
power-house has to be situated miles back in such
inaccessible wilds that the greatest difficulty has
been encountered in carrying machinery and supplies
to the spot. At one point in the Sierras
men and material were transported across two
yawning chasms by means of wire cables, under
which ran a freight-carrier.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Feather River in California makes a big
horseshoe bend twenty-five miles above Oroville,
coming within three miles of itself again. An
enormous mountain intervenes, but the engineers
tunneled that and diverted the water into that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
tunnel. In the lower end of that black, rushing,
underground torrent are placed the great turbines
and generators.</p>

<p class='c011' >The most striking instance of the results of
securing a big headway for a small stream is
shown in San Juan County, Colorado. The
Animus River in its course between Silverton and
Durango, a distance of twenty miles, has a gradual
fall of about fifteen hundred feet. Although
called a river, it is but a mountain stream, tumbling
over little falls and through rock-strewn
gullies, at no point showing more power than
would be sufficient to drive a very small grist-mill.
But the genius of science has so cunningly
diverted it and concentrated its energy as to develop
at last 40,000 horse-power.</p>

<p class='c011' >A dam was built a few miles below Silverton,
and the water turned into a flume which is only
six by eight feet in size. It will be seen that it
must be a very small stream whose waters can
be run through such a restricted channel. Across
fearful cañons and around great mountains,
through tunnels and cuttings that flume carries
the water for sixteen miles to the edge of a great
cliff near Durango. The cliff is over one thousand
feet high, and the pipe runs over the edge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
and makes a perpendicular drop into the power-house
below.</p>

<p class='c011' >From the four-foot steel pipe, nozzles five-eighths
of an inch in diameter conduct the water
into the turbines, whirling them at a speed of
four thousand revolutions per minute. The
speed of the jets of water shooting from those
nozzles is 25,000 feet, or over four miles per
minute.</p>

<p class='c011' >Note how the wizards of industry further concentrate
and control the giant they have evoked.
That forty-thousand horse-power making that
mighty plunge over the cliff is met by magical
machines and switched into a wire but little larger
than a lead-pencil. Forty feet of that unyielding
steel flume which held the power is a load for
a freight car; forty feet of the wire which carries
the power is but a small load for a six-year-old
boy.</p>

<p class='c011' >At one moment the power is in that roaring,
headlong, terrific plunge&mdash;the next, it is miles
away, invisible, noiseless, and mysterious, illuminating
great arc-lamps, running heavy cars, and&mdash;to
come from great to small&mdash;whirling dainty
fans or cooking an egg.</p>

<p class='c011' >There are other marvelous power-plants situated
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
on rivers where, although the force is far
less than that of the mountain torrents, the volume
of water is far greater. Idaho shows the
most remarkable of the developments of such
water-power, and the astounding ingenuity and
determination of the genii are shown as much as
in the mountains. The Bear River, which runs
through Idaho and Utah, carries a very large flow
at an exceedingly rapid rate&mdash;for a river. At
one point in Idaho no less than six great power-houses
have been installed on that river, producing
a total of nearly 200,000 horse-power. In order
to secure good headway, and the force which
this gives, two enormous pipe-lines have been
built to take the water from upper reaches of the
river, and, while holding that pipe almost to a
level, run it across country to a lower reach,
where a power-house is built, thus increasing the
headway from nothing to two or three hundred
feet.</p>

<p class='c011' >One of these lines is of eleven-foot pipe, nearly
five miles long; the other is a sixteen-foot pipe,
half a mile long. Almost all of the current produced
at these plants is transmitted by cable to
Salt Lake City, 135 miles away.</p>

<p class='c011' >It has been said by expert engineers of electrical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
development that it will be but a short time
before the intermountain region will use no coal,
that all smoke-stacks and chimneys will be abolished
and electricity furnish all the power, heat,
and light not only to cities and towns, but to farming
communities.</p>

<p class='c011' >We are on the way. There are some districts
now where villages, towns, and farms all use
electricity for power and for lighting and cooking.
This is notably so in Rupert, Idaho, the
home of the famous electric high school, described
in "St. Nicholas" in September, 1913.</p>

<p class='c011' >All through that town the lighting and cooking
in even the humblest homes is by electricity. The
few small factories use no coal or steam-power.
In the mountain region over one hundred cities,
towns, and rural communities have electric wires
in their houses. All are lighted by them and
very many have thrown out coal ranges and cook
by electricity.</p>

<p class='c011' >The region is one of mines everywhere, some
of them the largest in the world; and nearly all of
them have discarded their gigantic steam-, hoisting-,
and pumping-engines for electric motors.
There is, it is asserted, more than enough water-power
running to waste to do every particle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
work now done by steam, horses, and men and
women in the region, from impelling the enormous
sixteen-wheeled mountain Moguls to rocking
the babies' cradles by motor.</p>

<p class='c011' >Across the northern part of Idaho and Montana,
over a wicked country of mountains and
cañons, the western division of the Chicago, Milwaukee,
and St. Paul Railroad runs all its trains
by electricity, as you have read in your last
month's number of "St. Nicholas," while farther
south, across Utah and Colorado, the Denver and
Rio Grande Railroad Company completed its
plans three years ago for the electrification of its
road to Denver; but the scheme of the kaiser to
lick the world in ninety days failing, material
became too costly to warrant the change from
steam to electricity.</p>

<p class='c011' >But the power is ready or could quickly be
made ready. Every year the two great companies
which have been formed by the consolidation
of numerous small owners of power-plants, are
building dams and reservoirs and flumes, getting
ready for the not far distant day when steam-engines
will have to be looked for in the Museum
of Antiques and Curiosities in Salt Lake City.</p>

  <h2 id='ch16' class='c012'><span class='xlarge'>OUT IN THE BIG-GAME COUNTRY</span><br /> <br />BY CLARENCE H. ROWE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010' >In the big-game country! Is there a healthy,
red-blooded American boy who does not feel
a thrill of excitement at the thought? In spite of
our civilization, there is, in many, a lingering
thrill in the very thought of the chase, handed
down through a long line of ancestry dating back
to the time when the chase meant food rather
than sport.</p>

<p class='c011' >The stage setting for big game is perfect. In
the sheep country of Wyoming or the deer country
of Colorado it is at an altitude of from nine
to thirteen thousand feet above sea-level, where
the air is clear and crisp with the tang of winter,
the huge stretches of wild open country lying like
a picture at one's feet. Could anything be more
beautiful and invigorating?</p>

<p class='c011' >A reconnoitering-point will sometimes reveal a
view of almost a hundred miles. Across a gulch
of some twenty miles the distant buttresses of red
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
sandstone rock are painted with slashes of golden
copper, the somber pines straggling almost to the
top, interwoven with the delicate tracery of the
quaking asps, now beautifully colored by the
frosts. At our feet nestles a "park" (as the valleys
are called), and possibly a silvery thread of
water winds in and out. Nature paints with a
full, rich palette in this glorious Western country!
The skies rival those of Italy in depth, and,
while possibly a bit more crude in raw color, are,
for this very reason, more in keeping with the
broad, vigorous landscape.</p>

<p class='c011' >In the big-game country everything is big&mdash;not
only the game, but the mountains, the valleys, and
the people. Small statures bred in these surroundings
expand and broaden&mdash;it is only natural.</p>

<p class='c011' >All this seems far removed from the subject of
elk, Rocky Mountain sheep, and bear, but to every
true sportsman these constitute fully one half of
the game.</p>

<p class='c011' >The Rocky Mountain sheep are by far the most
majestic and dignified of the animals of this locality.
They are fond of the rock-studded mountain-sides,
and often a huge sentinel ram, silhouetted
against the sky, will reveal the feeding-place
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
of a group of ewes and lambs. The task now, if
one is fortunate enough to be to the windward of
him, is, after tethering your horse, to work slowly
and carefully to within range, usually from two
to four hundred yards. Distances out there are
most deceptive, owing to the clear, rarefied air,
and an object that seems to be a few hundred
yards distant may prove to be almost a mile.</p>

<p class='c011' >Elk come next, and the lucky hungry hunter
who has bagged his "six-point" buck would need
more space than at my command to tell how he
did it.</p>

<p class='c011' >Antelope surpass both sheep and elk for timidity.
They are extremely wary and possibly the
most difficult of all game to get within range.
They are found in the lower and open country.</p>

<p class='c011' >Underlying all the hopes and expectations in
the hunter's mind is the thought of <i>bear</i>, and of
course first of these stands the grizzly. These
are getting scarcer every year, and most of us, if
we <i>must</i> get a bear, will have to be content with
a yearling or a two-year-old black bear. There
is no special country for them. As a rule, in the
summer and fall they come down in the low parks
to feast on the berries. Toward winter they are
more likely to be found higher up the slopes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
After the first snow an occasional raid on the
highest and loneliest ranches is looked upon by
Bruin as "the thing." At one of the ranches nestling
at the foot of Mount Evans in Colorado,
miles away from any other habitation, a rancher
put a cow-bell on each of his horses when turned
loose, thinking to frighten the bears. Bruin had
a penchant for the frisky little colts gamboling
about the mountain-side and thought it quite
neighborly to chase the whole herd, mares and
all, helter-skelter down to the ranch. It was
quite common for the rancher to be aroused at
night by the clanging of bells and the clatter of
hoofs as the horses scampered into the corral.</p>

<p class='c011' >Sheep, elk, and bear all go above the timber-line.
The height of this line varies in different
sections; ten thousand to ten thousand five hundred
feet is an average.</p>

<p class='c011' >A good wiry horse that isn't gun-shy and will
allow packing the game back to camp is a necessity,
for often a bag is made too far from camp
for a regular pack-animal to bring in.</p>

<p class='c011' >Above all, in the confusion of getting together
the regular camp outfit, don't forget to slip a
paper of trout flies and line into the duffle bag.
The little streams winding through the parks will
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
reward an hour's casting with half a dozen or so
delicious mountain trout running from six to ten
inches in length. They are small, but make up in
quality and flavor. When the hunt is over, we
take our parting look at the grim old mountains,
so silent and peaceful, and wend our way back to
civilization, happy and humble in the overpowering
glory and majesty of what the natives call
"God's own country."</p>
